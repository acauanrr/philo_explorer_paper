      "content": "After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the city\u2019s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the city\u2019s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the city\u2019s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The borough\u2019s robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan\u2019s, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors, more fearful of a gunman\u2019s crew than confident in the Police Department\u2019s ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller\u2019s arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. \u201cHere, we have nothing,\u201d she said. When it comes to \u201c  families,\u201d she said, the authorities \u201cdon\u2019t really care as much. That\u2019s how I feel. \u201d The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides  \u2014   14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  \u2014   strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers\u2019 view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives\u2019 phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victim\u2019s friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother\u2019s apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews\u2019 threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Mary\u2019s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,\u201d a sergeant\u2019s police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot through your window. \u201d Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers\u2019 names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, \u201cthen said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,\u201d Mr. Fernandez\u2019s wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to \u201cslap\u201d her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because \u201cthey are the ones snitching,\u201d her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinct\u2019s residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  \u2014   dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  \u2014   bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the city\u2019s   campaign. \u201cI haven\u2019t got one single phone call that\u2019s putting me in the right direction here,\u201d said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precinct\u2019s detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim\u2019s aunt about why the killer had not been caught. \u201cAnd people just don\u2019t understand that. \u201d Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third  \u2014   66 victims  \u2014   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city, the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. \u201cI need to bring something in today to justify my existence,\u201d Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. \u201cSo now you\u2019re in a small area, and day after day you\u2019re hammering the same community. Of course that community\u2019s eventually going to turn on you. \u201d The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. \u201cSome of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,\u201d said Hector Espada, a   veteran of the precinct. \u201cNot because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you can\u2019t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. \u201d Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be \u201cticket fixing,\u201d or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like   that put them in   situations on the street. \u201cWhenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud,\u201d said Russell Lewis, a    of the 40th. \u201cIt was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didn\u2019t want to get caught up in anything. \u201d The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  \u2014   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. O\u2019Neill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. O\u2019Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to people\u2019s concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. \u201cThat perception really sticks,\u201d he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinct\u2019s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    \u2014   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the Detectives\u2019 Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the department\u2019s efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: \u201cIf I cooperate with the detectives, there\u2019s so much work, there\u2019s so few of them there, they won\u2019t even get the chance to protect me, or they\u2019ll be there too late when the retaliation comes. \u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. \u201cWe fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had,\u201d he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Times\u2019s analysis of confidential staffing data, the department\u2019s chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinct\u2019s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city\u2019s last \u201c\u201d the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. \u201cAny crime in Manhattan has to be solved,\u201d said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. \u201cThe outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. \u201d Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last year\u2019s homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan,\u201d said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the money is. \u201d He added: \u201cWhen de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then he\u2019s done the complete opposite of what he said. It\u2019s just business as usual. \u201d The Bronx\u2019s struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn\u2019s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice O\u2019Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney\u2019s office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, \u201cI was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they can\u2019t be impartial because they don\u2019t trust the police. \u201d Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzo\u2019s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son\u2019s ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precinct\u2019s homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist\u2019s help. Victims\u2019 families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would \u201cget what you deserve. \u201d The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a woman\u2019s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  \u2014   about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  \u2014   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor\u2019s permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandez\u2019s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victim\u2019s advocate in the district attorney\u2019s office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissioner\u2019s office. \u201cWe went to all proper channels for help,\u201d the note said. \u201cBoth precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. \u201d \u201c40th and PSA 7 won\u2019t do anything,\u201d he wrote, referring to the local substation. \u201cPlease we need to speak to some one with authority. \u201d The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry O\u2019Sullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman\u2019s apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. \u201cI have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I know for sure: God, if we\u2019re in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. \u201d Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. \u201cI\u2019m bending over backward, and nobody\u2019s not even doing anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy am I going to help you, if you ain\u2019t going to help me?\u201d By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector O\u2019Sullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. \u201cNo one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment,\u201d he said. Mr. Fernandez\u2019s complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away."

      "content": "When Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cBambi\u201d opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the film\u2019s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to \u201cBambi,\u201d which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the film\u2019s title character, the artist, Tyrus Wong, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  \u2014   and, in the hope of making a life in America, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  \u2014   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. Wong did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso, Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios, among them \u201cThe Sands of Iwo Jima\u201d (1949) \u201cRebel Without a Cause\u201d (1955) and \u201cThe Wild Bunch\u201d (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for \u201cBambi\u201d that Mr. Wong was  \u2014   belatedly  \u2014   most renowned. \u201cHe was truly involved with every phase of production,\u201d John Canemaker, an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University, said in an interview for this obituary in March. \u201cHe created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. \u201d In 2013 and 2014, Mr. Wong was the subject of \u201cWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,\u201d a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum\u2019s windows, which overlook San Francisco Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States, leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  \u2014   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a \u201cpaper son\u201d  \u2014   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  \u2014   or, in the case of Gen Yeo and his father, \u201cpaper sons\u201d posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. \u201cAngel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,\u201d Lisa See, the author of \u201cOn Gold Mountain\u201d (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: \u201cThe goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. \u201d Because Mr. Wong\u2019s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. \u201cI was scared half to death I just cried,\u201d Mr. Wong recalled in \u201cTyrus,\u201d an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom, which premiered in 2015. \u201cEvery day is just miserable  \u2014   miserable. I hated that place. \u201d On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young Gen Yeo, posing as Look Tai Yow, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher Americanized \u201cTai Yow\u201d to \u201cTyrus,\u201d and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  \u2014   possibly more  \u2014   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  \u2014   a small fortune  \u2014   to let him stay on as Otis\u2019s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist Benji Okubo, he founded the Oriental Artists\u2019 Group of Los Angeles, which organized exhibitions of members\u2019 work  \u2014   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong, newly married and needing steady work, joined Disney in 1938 as an \u201c\u201d creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios, and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact, first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  \u2019s job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  \u2014   \u201ca terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,\u201d Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting \u201cBambi, a Life in the Woods,\u201d the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\u201d a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  \u2014   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  \u2014   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for \u201cBambi,\u201d it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. \u201cI said, \u2018Gee, this is all outdoor scenery,\u2019\u201d he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: \u201cI said, \u2018Gee, I\u2019m a landscape painter! \u2019\u201d Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 \u2014  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  \u2014   at once lush and spare  \u2014   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. \u201cWalt Disney went crazy over them,\u201d said Mr. Canemaker, who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book \u201cBefore the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists\u201d (1996). \u201cHe said, \u2018I love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. \u2019\u201d Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. \u201cBut he was more than that,\u201d Mr. Canemaker explained. \u201cHe was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. \u201d Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of \u201cBambi. \u201d Throughout the finished film  \u2014   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  \u2014   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employees\u2019 strike that year, Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  \u2014   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. Canemaker said  \u2014   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On \u201cBambi,\u201d Mr. Wong\u2019s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere \u201cbackground\u201d artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942, working there  \u2014   and lent out on occasion to other studios  \u2014   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former Ruth Kim, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. \u201cThen in a month you\u2019d go back there and the sign was still there,\u201d Mr. Wong recalled in \u201cTyrus. \u201d After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Mr. Wong, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists\u2019 Group. Mr. Wong\u2019s friend Mr. Okubo was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. \u201cIf World War II hadn\u2019t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,\u201d Ms. See said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. \u201d Mr. Wong, who became a United States citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland, Calif. he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  \u2014   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  \u2014   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong\u2019s life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on \u201cBambi,\u201d Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  \u2014   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray, Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  \u2014   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. See, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum\u2019s retrospective, \u201cWater to Paper, Paint to Sky,\u201d traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America, in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong\u2019s death, at his home in Sunland, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters, Kay Fong,   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others."

      "date": "2017-04-10",
      "content": "Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn\u2019t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  \u2014   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  \u2014   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona  \u2014   androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  \u2014   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  \u2014   I hesitate to say merry  \u2014   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, \u201cUntil then, here\u2019s another song. \u201d It was as if 2016 hadn\u2019t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can\u2019t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind  Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man\u2019s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis\u2019s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf\u2019s first media star. The gentleman\u2019s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  \u2014   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor\u2019s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  \u2014   his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  \u2014   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women\u2019s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball\u2019s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan\u2019s death evoked the 1980s White House, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn\u2019s had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War\u2019s roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing\u2019s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro\u2019s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and,   Edward Albee  \u2014   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  \u2014   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother\u2019s grief. Devotees of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape\u2019s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor\u2019s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the \u201cGodfather\u201d movies and \u201cBarney Miller,\u201d actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics\u2019 eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (\u201cAdventures of Superman\u201d) Alan Young (\u201cMister Ed\u201d) Robert Vaughn (\u201cThe Man From U. N. C. L. E. \u201d) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on \u201cThe Patty Duke Show\u201d) Dan Haggerty (\u201cThe Life and Times of Grizzly Adams\u201d) Florence Henderson (\u201cThe Brady Bunch\u201d) and Alan Thicke (\u201cGrowing Pains\u201d). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with \u201cHappy Days,\u201d \u201cMork  Mindy,\u201d \u201cLaverne  Shirley\u201d and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker\u2019s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  \u2014   what a picture!  \u2014   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music\u2019s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the \u201980s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone\u2019s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives."

      "content": "SEOUL, South Korea  \u2014   North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  \u2014   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons, the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New Year\u2019s Day speech, which was broadcast on the North\u2019s   KCTV on Sunday, Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. \u201cWe have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,\u201d he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months, taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea, President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9, is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months, it will test Mr. Trump\u2019s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions, North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim\u2019s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. Kim\u2019s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Mr. Cheong said. \u201cWe need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year\u2019s speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,\u201d he said. In his speech, Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the North\u2019s launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the North\u2019s satellite launch in February, South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  \u2014   far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere without breaking up. In April, North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. Kim said the North \u201ccan tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range. \u201d On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North."

      "content": "BEIJING  \u2014   President Tsai   of Taiwan sharply criticized China\u2019s leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. \u201cStep by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,\u201d she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a   news conference. Tensions between Taiwan and China, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan\u2019s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan. Despite Beijing\u2019s recent actions, which she said had \u201churt the feelings\u201d of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. \u201cWe will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,\u201d she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One China policy, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized China\u2019s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. Tsai\u2019s words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of China\u2019s show of strength. \u201cShe remains calm, rational and patient,\u201d Ms. Glaser wrote in an email. Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. Tsai\u2019s preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. Trump\u2019s bombastic style. Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to \u201cmaintain a balance among relations with China, relations with the United States and domestic politics. \u201d Ms. Tsai\u2019s vision, however, \u201cmay not align well with the incoming Trump administration\u2019s apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,\u201d he said. Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan. Ms. Tsai described the visit as \u201cunofficial,\u201d saying, \u201cA transit stop is just a transit stop. \u201d"

      "content": "Danny Cahill stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of NBC\u2019s reality television show \u201cThe Biggest Loser,\u201d shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  \u2014   an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months. When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec. 8, 2009, he weighed just 191 pounds, down from 430. Dressed in a   and   shorts, he was lean, athletic and as handsome as a model. \u201cI\u2019ve got my life back,\u201d he declared. \u201cI mean, I feel like a million bucks. \u201d Mr. Cahill left the show\u2019s stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with Jay Leno, Regis Philbin and Joy Behar. As he heard from fans all over the world, his elation knew no bounds. But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts. In fact, most of that season\u2019s 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now. Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8\u2019s contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose. Kevin Hall, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the \u201cBiggest Loser\u201d contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise. The results, the researchers said, were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss. \u201cIt is frightening and amazing,\u201d said Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. \u201cI am just blown away. \u201d It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  \u2014   even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  \u2014   will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that \u201cThe Biggest Loser\u201d contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended. What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants\u2019 metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight. Mr. Cahill was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat. The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nation\u2019s obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology. Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that, said Dr. Michael Schwartz, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, is \u201cnew and important. \u201d \u201cThe key point is that you can be on TV, you can lose enormous amounts of weight, you can go on for six years, but you can\u2019t get away from a basic biological reality,\u201d said Dr. Schwartz, who was not involved in the study. \u201cAs long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back. \u201d The show\u2019s doctor, Robert Huizenga, says he expected the contestants\u2019 metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned, though, whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off. \u201cUnfortunately, many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors, psychologists, sleep specialists, and trainers  \u2014   and that\u2019s something we all need to work hard to change,\u201d he said in an email. The study\u2019s findings, to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions, and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people. The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life. Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies, which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights, whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off. There is always a weight a person\u2019s body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  \u2014   it may be an effect of aging  \u2014   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail. Dr. David Ludwig, the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who was not involved in the research, said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But, he added, the findings made sense. \u201cThis is a subset of the most successful\u201d dieters, he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?\u201d Still, he added, \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches. \u201d Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved, they say, can progress truly be made against obesity. \u201cThere is a lot of basic research we still need to do,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Jackson, who is directing a project at Pfizer. Her group is testing a drug that, in animals at least, acts like leptin, a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin. While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active, the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: Erinn Egbert, a   caregiver for her mother in Versailles, Ky. And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t understand is that a treat is like a drug,\u201d said Ms. Egbert, who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show, and now weighs between 152 and 157. \u201cTwo treats can turn into a binge over a   period. That is what I struggle with. \u201d Six years after Season 8 ended, 14 of the 16 contestants went to the N. I. H. last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked, but on further reflection, decided the numbers explained a lot. \u201cAll my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,\u201d Mr. Cahill said. \u201cThe moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, \u2018This is not right. Something is wrong with my body. \u2019\u201d Sean Algaier, 36, a pastor from Charlotte, N. C. feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again, and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence,\u201d he said. Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though. They constantly battled hunger, cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the season\u2019s finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned, their leptin levels drifted up again, but only to about half of what they had been when the season began, the researchers found, thus helping to explain their urges to eat. Leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger, and although Dr. Hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them, another group of researchers, in a different project, did. In a   study funded by Australia\u2019s National Health and Medical Research Council, Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds, but over the next year, the pounds started coming back. Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose. \u201cWhat was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is,\u201d Dr. Proietto said. \u201cThe body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use. \u201d Mr. Cahill, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat, then fatter. He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward, he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with shame. Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485. \u201cI used to look at myself and think, \u2018I am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman,\u2019\u201d he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating. \u201cI remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought, \u2018I should just run out in front of a car. \u2019\u201d He eventually seized on \u201cThe Biggest Loser\u201d as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected. Before the show began, the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the \u201cBiggest Loser\u201d ranch with the other contestants, Mr. Cahill exercised seven hours a day, burning 8, 000 to 9, 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating, consuming many fewer calories than before. Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own. Mr. Cahill set a goal of a   deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it. His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a. m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  \u2014   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower, ride home, eat lunch  \u2014   typically a grilled skinless chicken breast, a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise. If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times, he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his   indicator reset to zero at midnight. On the day of the   on the show\u2019s finale, Mr. Cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained, to their surprise and horror, after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in. Mr. Cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever, and for the next four years, he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago, he went back to his job as a surveyor, and the pounds started coming back. Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. Cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again, to 275, then 295. His slow metabolism is part of the problem, and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few. \u201cI\u2019d eat five bites. Then I\u2019d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, \u2018What did I do? \u2019\u201d Dr. Lee Kaplan, an obesity researcher at Harvard, says the brain sets the number of calories we consume, and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories. Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies, said the body\u2019s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still, pounds can insidiously creep on. \u201cWe eat about 900, 000 to a million calories a year, and burn them all except those annoying 3, 000 to 5, 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThese very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  \u2014   less than one Starburst candy  \u2014   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating. \u201d \u201cIt is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging,\u201d Dr. Rosenbaum added. The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. Hall said. Yes, there are signals to regain weight, but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out. He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain, and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost, they were, without realizing it, eating an additional 200 calories a day. Those extra calories, Dr. Hall said, were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry. \u201cUnless they continue to fight it constantly, they will regain the weight,\u201d he said. All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  \u2014     or   diets, for example  \u2014   and to exercise and   drugs, among other interventions. But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. \u201cThere are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories,\u201d he said, but he added that \u201cfor most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  \u2014   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months. \u201d Dr. Rosenbaum agreed. \u201cThe difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ,\u201d he said. Mr. Cahill knows that now. And with his report from Dr. Hall\u2019s group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain. \u201cThat shame that was on my shoulders went off,\u201d he said."

She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband. It was \u201cThese Days,\u201d the version sung by Nico, the German   made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. Actually, the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy, now 38, on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Ms. Kerr can\u2019t remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down \u201clike Tigger,\u201d as she put it. In answering the usual     questions, Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for \u201cGirls,\u201d the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham. That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing. \u201cYour music has changed my life!\u201d she told Mr. Leahy. Mr. Leahy, who is quiet but not shy (at least he doesn\u2019t jump up and down upon meeting people) was mesmerized. \u201cMy main reaction,\u201d he said, \u201cwas it\u2019s a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you\u2019re working on a hit show. \u201d They exchanged email addresses, more an act of politeness than promise. Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year. Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives, but they were focused on their careers. Mr. Leahy, who grew up in Laconia, N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year. Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on \u201cGirls. \u201d The team has also worked on films including \u201cTrainwreck\u201d and television series such as \u201cNew Girl. \u201d In addition, Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for \u201cSurvivor\u2019s Remorse\u201d on Starz. Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego, graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York, where she took a job as an assistant at Elle magazine. In 2005 she moved back to the West Coast, to Los Angeles, and with a fellow Elle alum,  Katherine Power, created a company best known for its website, Who What Wear, which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors. Ms. Kerr and Ms. Power also started the Who What Wear clothing and accessories line sold at Target. It was nine months after their initial meeting that Mr. Leahy emailed Ms. Kerr. He had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry. Ms. Kerr, Mr. Leahy and his friend met for a long, boozy brunch. They began to email and text a bit. \u201cThere was banter,\u201d Ms. Kerr said, but neither knew the interest or intention of the other. A few months later, she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band Lord Huron. Mr. Leahy happens to be a friend of Ben Schneider, the band\u2019s lead singer, and had an extra ticket. \u201cThis was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. He and Ms. Kerr met up at the show. That is when Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr moved into the ambiguous \u201cmixtape era,\u201d in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy \u201care we just friends or what\u201d texts revolving around music. For example, Ms. Kerr was visiting New York and texted Mr. Leahy a request for \u201cwalking around SoHo music. \u201d He sent her a link to \u201cLove Me Again,\u201d by John Newman. It has a club vibe but romantic lyrics. \u201cI wanted to read into it,\u201d Ms. Kerr said, but she figured (correctly, it turns out) that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her. Another time he emailed her a link to a Fleetwood Mac version of \u201cNeed Your Love So Bad. \u201d After listening to it, Ms. Kerr said, \u201cI called my friend Katie. \u201d \u201cAt that time,\u201d she continued, \u201cI just referred to him as \u2018the supervisor.\u2019 She knew I had a crush on him. She said, \u2018How can it not mean something? \u2019\u201d Mr. Leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending Ms. Kerr a message with this song. \u201cI sort of thought, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s too much. \u2019\u201d But he shared it with her anyway. (This is the same man who sent her the song \u201cBedBedBedBedBed, Vacationer Remix,\u201d by Deleted Scenes, \u201cduring the friend phase,\u201d Ms. Kerr said.) Ms. Kerr played the game, too. She made Mr. Leahy a mix CD (handwritten liner notes and all) that she titled \u201cFeynman Diagrams for All,\u201d after Mr. Leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of Feynman diagrams  \u2014   in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles  \u2014   was romantic. On the mix, Ms. Kerr included the Mazzy Star song \u201cI\u2019ve Been Let Down. \u201d It was \u201ca bit of an Easter egg of my actual feelings,\u201d she said. Around this time, Ms. Kerr texted Mr. Leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar,  the Roger Room. She had focused on a drink named for the song \u201cChristmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis,\u201d which happens to be Mr. Leahy\u2019s favorite Tom Waits tune. \u201cThis made me rethink things a bit,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cHillary Kerr was clearly not to be trifled with. \u201d In early 2014, Mr. Leahy invited her to a Bleachers concert. The band\u2019s lead singer is Jack Antonoff, who is Ms. Dunham\u2019s boyfriend. Ms. Dunham was at the concert as well, and on meeting Ms. Kerr, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about you. \u201d Ms. Kerr and Mr. Leahy shared their first kiss that night. He proposed to her on Polihale Beach in Kauai, Hawaii, on Jan. 1, 2016. On Dec. 10, 125 friends and relatives gathered in Palm Springs, Calif. at the Colony Palms Hotel, which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster Al Wertheimer and whose poolside guests have included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Kirk Douglas and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ms. Kerr walked down a grassy aisle in a   courtyard wearing a structured lace Reem Acra dress, strapless with a bustier and a full skirt. Four musicians played \u201cOnce, With Feeling,\u201d an instrumental song Mr. Leahy wrote for Ms. Kerr. . Just minutes into the cocktail reception, a few of Ms. Kerr\u2019s best friends descended upon her. Jen Atkin, the celebrity hairstylist and social media star, started fussing with the flower she had sewn into the bride\u2019s hair. Joey Maalouf, the celebrity makeup artist who is a creator of the       service the Glam App, whipped out a tube of lip gloss and reapplied it to the bride\u2019s pucker. He had done her makeup. \u201cThe look we went for is sickeningly stunning and perfect,\u201d he said. Guests mingled over drinks by the pool, which was framed by banquette tables lit from above by strings of bulbs. The sky turned pink before the stars appeared, and guests snapped photos and shared them with the hundreds of thousands who follow these members of the   illuminati (#imwithkerr and #letsgetleahyed). \u201cThis looks like it\u2019s art directed,\u201d Eva Chen, the head of fashion partnerships for Instagram, said as she took it all in. She had worked as an assistant at Elle with Ms. Kerr. Friends of both the bride and the groom celebrated what they saw as a great match, based on passion not only for each other but also for music. Leigh Belz Ray, the features and news director at InStyle, was another former Elle colleague who made the trip. \u201cHillary loves music, and it\u2019s not just a casual thing,\u201d Ms. Ray said. \u201cWe used to say the ultimate fantasy was to become a music director, and now she\u2019s married to one. \u201d After a romantic first dance to Solomon Burke\u2019s \u201cIf You Need Me,\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Leahy (she will use her maiden name professionally) settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a D. J. And before they left for their Hawaiian honeymoon, Mr. Leahy completed his first important act as husband. He pulled together many of the songs that could be considered the soundtrack to their romance and made his wife a mixtape. When Dec. 10, 2016 Where Colony Palms Hotel, Palm Springs, Calif. Flora The bride and groom were married under a white birch trellis, because white birch is the state tree of New Hampshire, where Mr. Leahy grew up and where his parents, Richard and Marie Leahy, reside. The structure was wrapped in white peonies, Sahara roses and camellia greens. Readings Mr. Leahy\u2019s family is Roman Catholic Ms. Kerr\u2019s parents, John and Carole Kerr, are more spiritual than religiously observant. Many of the guests had an artistic bent. The bride and groom planned accordingly. Marshall Goldsmith, an executive coach, author and lifelong family friend of Ms. Kerr, officiated. Friends and relatives stood to read poems from James Kavanaugh and Mary Oliver, as well as a passage from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 ruling legalizing   marriage. \u201cA little Catholic priest, a little lesbian Pulitzer Prize winner, a little equal rights for all,\u201d Ms. Kerr explained after the ceremony."

      "content": "Angels are everywhere in the Mu\u00f1iz family\u2019s apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall, ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR, angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As Jos\u00e9 and Zoraida Mu\u00f1iz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. Zoraida\u2019s early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children\u2019s father withdrew support. Then Zoraida\u2019s grandfather  \u2014   the father of her absent father  \u2014   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met Jos\u00e9, a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle, a judge, they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction, using skills she learned as a child, and in a clothing store. But in 1987, Mr. Mu\u00f1iz began having violent seizures  \u2014   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life, they started a family. Their first child, Jos\u00e9 Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. That\u2019s where the angels came in  \u2014   the first one was a painting, a gift from a cousin.  \u201cWhen they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1iz, 50, said. \u201cFrom there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. \u201d All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the Mu\u00f1izes\u2019 overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, much of it restored by Ms. Mu\u00f1iz. \u201cSo many people throw away things, so I don\u2019t have to buy,\u201d she said. A second son, Jesus, became epileptic at 3. A girl, Maria, completed the family. In 2007, Mr. Mu\u00f1iz had what felt like a horrible, stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Mu\u00f1iz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. \u201cI\u2019m willing to take anything with him,\u201d she said. \u201cI never left him alone, and I never will. \u201d Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Mu\u00f1iz\u2019s life, surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured, depressed and unable to speak, he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the Mu\u00f1iz children grew up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through every craziness,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Jr. 24, who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment, \u201cevery up and down. \u201d For years at a time, the family held on, seemingly by a thread. Over the summer, the younger son, Jesus, 22, got a   job at a Zaro\u2019s Bakery in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. Because the family\u2019s rent is tied to income, the rent tripled in August, to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for Jos\u00e9 Sr. \u2019s mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Mu\u00f1iz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent, got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund, the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college, where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness, she wants to be an oncologist. Jos\u00e9 Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academy\u2019s photography program. But Jos\u00e9 Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family, sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. \u201cThey give me my strength, even if I have times I collapse,\u201d she said. Jos\u00e9 Jr. agreed. \u201cI use my parents and siblings as my motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all there for each other,\u201d Ms. Mu\u00f1iz said."

      "content": "With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House, it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all, Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax, threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December, after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up, up and away soared the offers  \u2014   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end, the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million, more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  \u2014   oil leases  \u2014   in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil, the Norwegian oil company, which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built, but we do know this: The energy transition is real, and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale, more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year, a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States, with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees examine the facts, they will learn that   technician is projected to be the   occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama\u2019s strong push to tackle global warming. Now, of course, everything is in flux. In the worst case, with a sufficiently pliant Congress, Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump\u2019s part, his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters, when Mr. Trump gets to the White House, he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy, and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas, which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced, and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides, but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed, with the latest development coming only last week, when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy, and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years, in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies, he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley, the senior senator from Iowa. That state  \u2014     in presidential politics, let us remember  \u2014   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. \u201cSenator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry,\u201d said Tom Kiernan, the head of the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group. When I spoke with him last week, Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his group\u2019s calculations, $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. \u201cWe are creating jobs throughout America,   jobs, and we think   Trump will want that to continue,\u201d he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock, he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates, a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight, some Republican senators would defect on principle, and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance, what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming, that consensus is fragile, he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now, other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so, but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations, the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together,\u201d Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do, but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real, it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind, but for the United States as a whole, the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris, even if kept, are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement, the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president, but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy, seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month, global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014. If nothing else, the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality."

      "title": "Can Carbon Capture Technology Prosper Under Trump? - The New York Times",
      "publication": "New York Times",
      "author": "John Schwartz",
      "date": "2017-01-05",
      "content": "THOMPSONS, Tex.  \u2014   Can one of the most promising  \u2014   and troubled  \u2014   technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump? The technology, carbon capture, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. Trump\u2019s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change, a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees, might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives. But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here, about 30 miles southwest of Houston, is a bright spot for the technology\u2019s supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget, unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up, the plant, which is attached to one of the power company NRG\u2019s hulking   units, will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3, 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant, the largest in the Lone Star State. Still, it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  \u2014   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles, or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214, 338 homes. From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation, the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic, with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant\u2019s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream, pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment, is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines, which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator, or stripper, which heats the amine and releases the CO2. The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use, and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2. Petra Nova, a   joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration, will not just grab the CO2, it will use it, pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, that should increase production to 15, 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project, what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation. The plant, which has received $190 million from the federal government, can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel, said David Knox, an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January, Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to declare victory before it\u2019s time. \u201d If the price of oil stabilizes or rises, and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop, he said, utilities might ask, \u201cwhy would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?\u201d But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far, problems have bedeviled major projects, often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen, which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration. Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  \u2014   a problem known as \u201cparasitic load. \u201d The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose, which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be, and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less, thanks to lessons learned this time around. If Petra Nova succeeds, it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon capture\u2019s problems, its supporters, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency, call the technology, known as carbon capture sequestration, crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have C. C. S. the chance of success goes down, and the cost of success goes up,\u201d said Julio Friedmann, an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. \u201cIf you do have C. C. S. the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down. \u201d Carbon capture is proving itself, said David Mohler, the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department. Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially, he said. \u201cYou cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  \u2014   you really have to do this stuff in the real world,\u201d he said. Driving down costs, he noted, is what engineers and businesses do through research, development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. \u201cWe do figure things out as we go,\u201d he said. What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is, at this point, anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cThe technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere,\u201d said Mark Brownstein, a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund. But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope. \u201cI actually think it\u2019s a moment of optimism,\u201d said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp   legislation  with another Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. \u201cWhat I saw with the   was a laserlike focus on jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he was intrigued\u201d about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix, she added. One of the pillars of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of   clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation, it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants, but also carbon dioxide. Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses, too, were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology, since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. \u201cThe decision they are making is not, what does the political outlook look like today? What\u2019s it look like over the life of this plant?\u201d Although she concedes that a   revival of coal\u2019s fortunes is unlikely, carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation\u2019s energy mix diverse. Jeff Erikson, general manager at the Global C. C. S. Institute, which promotes the technology, said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry,\u201d he said, but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes, or can even be pumped into the ground. One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant, in La Porte, Tex. where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to   power generation. In a $140 million, 50 megawatt demonstration project, the company, Net Power, will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system, invented by a British engineer, Rodney Allam, eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure, pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require. The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants, the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means, in effect, that \u201cthe cost of being green is zero,\u201d said Bill Brown, the chief executive of Net Power. \u201cThe potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer,\u201d said Fatima Maria Ahmad, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank. Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation, a power company, the engineering and construction firm CBI, and 8 Rivers Capital, which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  \u2014   \u201crapid unplanned disassembly\u201d  \u2014   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence. Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nation\u2019s carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress, consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe, where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. \u201cWe see this very much playing into all parts of the world,\u201d said Daniel McCarthy, executive vice president for CBI\u2019s technology operating group. Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture, said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for Sierra Club. \u201cThis is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community,\u201d he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal, with all of its environmental baggage, in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don\u2019t pollute the atmosphere in the first place. Dr. Friedmann, the former energy official, predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. \u201cIt\u2019s convenient to just say \u2018Keep it in the ground,\u2019 \u201d he said, referring to an   slogan. \u201cWhat I prefer to say is \u2018Keep it from the air. \u2019\u201d"

      "content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  \u2014   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend, he did it in   opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump\u2019s    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump\u2019s   private club in Florida, where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City, is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president\u2019s winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the property\u2019s original owner, who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million, turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trump\u2019s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite, and he opened up   \u2019s membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November,    has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long,\u201d said Jeff Greene, a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010, who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch, upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold, beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a scene resembling a mansion in \u201cSunset Boulevard\u201d or \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d two of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite movies. At night, the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd, among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next, the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Year\u2019s Eve party on Saturday night, a   white menu included \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s wedge salad,\u201d a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a \u201cbreakfast buffet. \u201d Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump\u2019s two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump\u2019s combative public persona  \u2014   often on display during his campaign  \u2014   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. \u201c   is an environment he can control,\u201d said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. \u201cI watched him hold court  \u2014   he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed. \u201d Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors. He described the   as \u201cseeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious. \u201d Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip, he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job, Rex W. Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him \u201cMr. Exxon. \u201d) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs, which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns, the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy, the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is Mexico\u2019s richest man. Mr. Trump his wife, Melania and their    son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (\u201cMy Way,\u201d a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from \u201cFiddler on the Roof. \u201d Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so  \u2014   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner\u2019s coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important \u201cthat we keep Donald and his family safe. \u201d Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around, and expect it will continue. \u201cThe loser in this game is Camp David,\u201d said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. \u201cOnce you\u2019re at    and it\u2019s so opulent and   the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp David\u2019s Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely. \u201d"

When you woke up this morning, what did you do first? Did you hop in the shower, check your email or grab a doughnut? What did you say to your roommates on the way out the door? Salad or hamburger for lunch? When you got home, did you put on your sneakers and go for a run, or eat dinner in front of the television? Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of   decision making, but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re habits. And though each habit means relatively little on its own, over time, the meals we eat, how we spend our evenings, and how often we exercise have enormous impacts. This is particularly true in our 20s, when so many of our habits are still up for grabs. The patterns you establish right now will impact your health, productivity, financial security and happiness for decades. How much money you make, how much time you spend with your friends and family, how well your body functions years from now  \u2014   all of these, in many ways, are products of the habits you are building today. (Related: The 8 health habits experts say you need in your 20s) And in the last decade, our understanding of the neurology of habit formation has been transformed. We\u2019ve learned how habits form  \u2014   and why they are so hard to break. We now know how to create good habits and change bad ones like never before. At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: A cue, a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits  \u2014   such as exercise habits  \u2014   you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards. In 2002, researchers at New Mexico State University studied 266 individuals, most of whom worked out at least three times a week. They found that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim, or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives. However, the reason they continued exercising  \u2014   why it became a habit  \u2014   was because of a specific cue and a specific reward. If you want to start running each morning, it\u2019s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day) and a clear reward (like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that, at first, the rewards inherent in exercise aren\u2019t enough. So to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward, you need to give yourself something you really enjoy  \u2014   like a small piece of chocolate  \u2014   after your workout. This is counterintuitive, because most people start exercising to lose weight. But the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue (\u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock\u201d) with a routine (\u201cThree miles down! \u201d) and a reward (\u201cChocolate! \u201d). Eventually, your brain will start expecting the reward inherent in exercise (\u201cIt\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock. Three miles down! Endorphin rush! \u201d) and you won\u2019t need the chocolate anymore. In fact, you won\u2019t even want it. But until your neurology learns to enjoy those endorphins and the other rewards inherent in exercise, you need to   the process. And then, over time, it will become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. You won\u2019t want the chocolate anymore. You\u2019ll just crave the endorphins. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, will start triggering a craving for the inherent rewards to come. Want more?

      "content": "A new report by a leading watchdog group has identified 2016 as the \u201cworst year yet\u201d for Christian persecution, ever since the organization began monitoring persecution 25 years ago. [The report, which is produced annually by Open Doors USA, found that persecution of Christians rose globally for the third year in a row, reaching \u201cunprecedented levels\u201d in countries located in South and Southeast Asia, among other locations.  \u201cChristians throughout the world continue to risk imprisonment, loss of home and assets, torture, beheadings, rape and even death as a result of their faith,\u201d the report stated. The World Watch List (WWL) ranks the 50 countries across the globe where persecution of Christians is most severe. In 25 years of chronicling and ranking the political and societal restrictions on religious freedom experienced by Christians worldwide, Open Doors researchers identified 2016 as the \u201cworst year yet. \u201d The report corroborated an earlier study from the   Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR) which found that during the year 2016, some 90, 000 Christians were killed for their faith around the world. The director of CESNUR and leader of the study, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that Christians are \u201cthe most persecuted religious group in the world,\u201d and the numbers of those affected are staggering. Islamic extremism remains the dominant driver of Christian persecution in the world, responsible for initiating oppression and conflict in 35 out of the 50 countries on the 2017 list. Moreover, nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer \u201cextreme persecution\u201d have populations that are at least 50% Muslim. \u201cIslamic oppression remains the most common cause of pressure against Christians,\u201d the report states, \u201cand it is rising most sharply in Africa, where more people are killed for their Christian faith than anywhere else in the world. \u201d For the 14th straight year, North Korea tops the list as the most dangerous place to be a Christian, followed by Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Eritrea and Yemen. While killings of Christians in Nigeria saw a dramatic increase of more than 62 percent in 2016, the most violent nation is now Pakistan, which climbed to No. 4 on the list for a level of   violence \u201cexceeding even northern Nigeria. \u201d Last Easter Sunday, an Islamist terror group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban carried out a suicide bombing in Lahore, Pakistan, killing more than 70 children and adults. \u201cThe target was Christians,\u201d said a spokesman for the group, adding that the jihadists wanted to send a message to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif \u201cthat we have entered Lahore. \u201d The Watch List examines the pressures faced by Christians in five spheres of life (private, family, community, national, and church) plus levels of religiously motivated violence, in order to rank the top 50 countries where \u201cChristians face the most persecution. \u201d By the specific criteria used, approximately 215 million Christians experience high, very high, or extreme persecution, the study found.

      "publication": "Breitbart",
      "author": "Mark Tapson",
      "date": "2017-01-16",
      "content": "After eight years of treasonous subversion by Barack Obama\u2019s radical administration to fundamentally transform the United States, Donald Trump\u2019s election victory is galvanizing a revival of American exceptionalism. But Trump and his team face formidable opponents as they begin the Herculean task of reversing the course of Obama\u2019s failed presidency: not only a vengefully determined left but an entrenched Republican establishment in Washington D. C. and a stubborn contingent of Never Trumper politicians and pundits. [David Horowitz\u2019s new book, Big Agenda: President\u2019s Trump\u2019s Plan to Save America  \u2014   the first major book to be released on Trump\u2019s presidency  \u2014   lays out a strategy for combating those opponents of the  \u2019s conservative restoration.   The founder of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, the left\u2019s most hated apostate, and the right\u2019s most aggressive strategist, Horowitz reveals major components of Trump\u2019s plan for his first 100 days and his   agenda in the slim but essential Big Agenda (available Tuesday, January 17 from Humanix Books). The book has earned unqualified support from the likes of Dinesh D\u2019Souza, gay conservative firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer, Rush Limbaugh (who calls the book \u201ca road map for a winning agenda that conservatives will embrace\u201d) and Ann Coulter, who recommends it as a \u201cbrilliant battle plan. \u201d Horowitz begins by profiling the adversaries. \u201c[T]he first concern of Americans disturbed by the radicalism of the Obama years,\u201d he declares, is the division within the Republican party itself. For eight years the Republican Party mustered only tepid opposition to President Obama. This was a party made feckless by its incomprehension of the nature of the left, by a failure of nerve, and by a lack of the will to win. Then Trump barreled onto the scene with a readiness to \u201cdisregard the politically correct restraints on public discourse\u201d and to \u201crelentlessly attack\u201d Democrats who could dish it out but were unaccustomed to having it thrown back at them. As a result, the \u201cpassions Trump aroused in the electorate sparked a revolt in the Republican Party\u201d and thrust the political outsider ahead of his 16 rivals in the primaries and then on to election victory against Hillary Clinton.   Beyond the sharp division that still remains in his own party, Trump and his supporters face the   zealots of an ideology fueled by ugly, dehumanizing hatred for anyone who stands in the way of their utopian vision  \u2014   a hatred exemplified in Hillary\u2019s demonization of conservatives as \u201cirredeemable deplorables\u201d: racists, sexists, Islamophobes, homophobes, xenophobes  \u2014   \u201cyou name it,\u201d she said on the campaign trail. Trump fearlessly identified that hatred during the second presidential debate when he told the audience that \u201cHillary has tremendous hatred in her heart. \u201d Republicans have been playing defense for so long that Trump\u2019s willingness to publicly characterize progressives for what they are, Horowitz notes with admiration, \u201cwas probably unprecedented in the annals of modern presidential politics. \u201d Horowitz realized correctly that Trump was the only Republican who had a chance against Hillary. In Part Two of the book Horowitz identifies the leftist agenda, the overarching goal behind the issues, that Trump and the right must understand and counter. He points to Saul   progressives like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as evidence that the Democratic Party \u201chas moved so far to the left in recent decades that it now operates on the sixties\u2019 principle that the issues it advances are mere stepping stones on the way to more radical changes. \u201d Those changes mean the dismantling of individual freedom and the consolidation of power in the hands of the state. That explains the left\u2019s drive to establish a totalitarian infrastructure through their obsessive push for the passage of Obamacare, their religious devotion to save the planet from   \u201cclimate change\u201d (which they deem a greater threat to national security than terrorism) their social justice solutions to what they insist against all evidence is America\u2019s \u201csystemic racism,\u201d and their globalist pursuits, which include lawless Sanctuary Cities, open borders policies, and a willful blindness toward our Islamic fundamentalist enemy. Horowitz breaks down all of these issues to demonstrate how they are central to the left\u2019s   agenda.  Part Three, approximately half the book, presents Horowitz\u2019s strategy for the way forward. \u201cThe goal,\u201d he begins, \u201cis to put Democrats on the offensive  \u2026     to expose their hypocrisy and turn their firepower against them  \u2026     The strategy is to go for the jugular. \u201d Conservatives generally are uncomfortable with the idea of political brawling, even when on the ropes as they have been throughout the Obama years. But Horowitz stresses that if your first response to, say, the left\u2019s kneejerk use of the race card is to go on the defensive, then you are losing. \u201cTo turn around the political battles conservatives have been losing for so long, they must begin every confrontation by punching progressives in the mouth,\u201d he declares, referring to boxer Mike Tyson\u2019s famous observation that \u201ceverybody has a game plan until you punch them in the mouth. \u201d Donald Trump is better suited to pursuing such a strategy than any Republican leader in recent memory. Horowitz goes on to note that the right must attack the left with equal moral force, particularly at the Democrats\u2019 Achilles heel: their atrocious record on race as exemplified in their monopoly control of America\u2019s inner cities and the suffering and misery they have wrought there. Conservatives must also attack progressives for what Horowitz calls their wars on men and women, their leftist indoctrination in our schools, their politicized   institutions such as the progressive Ford Foundation, their powerful, thuggish government unions, and their corruption and foreign influence peddling. And the right must destroy the false narrative that the Democratic Party is the party of the people. In short, the right must, as one chapter title puts it, \u201cgo on the attack and stay on it. \u201d We must be as willing to morally stigmatize the left as they are us. We must fight fire with fire. And then we must take things a step further \u201cand create a unifying theme that has a moral resonance\u201d with which we can level the political playing field. \u201cThat theme is individual freedom\u201d: The New Republicanism must be a movement opposed to the progressives\u2019 sellout of American sovereignty, of America\u2019s historical uniqueness. It must be unapologetic in its patriotism and in its commitment to rebuilding America economically and militarily. Third, the New Republicanism must show its contempt for a political correctness that denies the virtues of America\u2019s culture, which is founded on individual rights and equality before the law. It must oppose progressive \u201cmulticulturalism,\u201d which seeks to replace this culture with   hierarchies of gender, class, and race. \u201cThis is the moral language Republicans need to use if they are going to defeat the progressive agenda,\u201d Horowitz insists. He concludes the book with a battle plan for the first 100 days that includes such recommendations as restoring Guantanamo, moving our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, defunding sanctuary cities, promoting energy independence, nixing illegal immigration amnesty, attacking IRS malfeasance, dismantling Obamacare, and following through on Trump\u2019s promise of a New Deal for black America. \u201cNo president since FDR and his famed \u2018100 Days\u2019 has the chance Donald Trump has,\u201d David Horowitz has said, to reshape the American political landscape at home and abroad  \u2014   if conservatives understand the nature of the enemy we face and how to engage them successfully.  Big Agenda succinctly educates the right about that enemy and maps a clear way forward to victory and restoration.

[In April, Trump\u2019s signed an executive order targeting abuse by U.

As Trump and Modi are expected to meet in Washington, D. C. India\u2019s top lawmakers want the   legal review dropped entirely. India Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma requested Modi tell Trump to \u201creverse\u201d his   crackdown. \u201cHe should demand and obtain credible and firm assurances from US President Donald Trump that he will reverse his decision which discriminates against Indian professionals  \u2026     He cannot return \u201d Sharma said. \u201cWe do not want mere statements and photographs,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWe want answers and also how the Prime Minister responds and registers our protest over the disparaging observations made about the Republic of India recently when US decided to walk out of the Paris (climate) pact. We will wait for the Prime Minister\u2019s response or reaction. \u201d India\u2019s outsourcing and   visa industry, which relies on U. S. companies firing Americans and replacing them with foreign workers, have been rattled by the mere prospect of changes to the unfettered globalization business model. As Breitbart Texas reported, in 2017 SEC filings, the   outsourcing firm Infosys, which is responsible for the displacement of thousands of American workers, seemed worried about their future. \u201cAn increase in   sentiments in certain countries in which we operate, including the United States and the United Kingdom, may lead to the enactment of restrictive legislations that could limit companies in those countries from outsourcing work to us, or could inhibit our ability to staff client projects in a timely manner thereby impacting our revenue and profitability,\u201d Infosys executives wrote in the SEC filing. Every year, more than 100, 000 foreign workers are brought to the U. S. on the   visa and allowed to stay for up to six years. That number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands each year, as universities and   are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U. S. through the visa, Americans are often replaced and forced to train their foreign replacements. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder. "

      "content": "On Thursday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) responded to Rep. Peter King\u2019s ( ) statement that he has seen no proof of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign by saying, \u201cI have to disagree with my colleague in terms of whether there is any evidence of collusion. I believe that there is. \u201d Schiff later added that it\u2019s \u201ccertainly premature\u201d to say that there will be no proof of collusion.  Anchor Chris Cuomo asked Schiff, \u201cNo proof, Peter King says. I\u2019ve seen no proof of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Carter Page says the allegations are laughable. What do you say?\u201d Schiff answered, \u201cWell, Carter Page is a person of interest to the committee, and I think, probably likely to come before the committee, so I don\u2019t want to comment on anything he\u2019s had to say in particular. But I do think that we need to get to the bottom of these allegations of collusion or coordination. I have to disagree with my colleague in terms of whether there is any evidence of collusion. I believe that there is. But nonetheless, this is something that we need to investigate. I think there was a reason why the FBI began its investigation, and why it continues that investigation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something the FBI does without any basis. But that\u2019s about as much as I can say without going into particulars. I will say this, I think it would be deeply irresponsible of us not to follow the facts wherever they lead, to do it objectively and not to predetermine a conclusion. But there\u2019s certainly, as we have seen from many of the public reports, ample reason to do this investigation. \u201d He later added that the investigation \u201cshouldn\u2019t be seen as a failure if we do our job, and we follow the facts wherever they lead and we reach a unified conclusion. We shouldn\u2019t go into this with the object that we want to score this political point or that political point or we want to come up ultimately, with a certain conclusion. we\u2019ll be doing our job if we thoroughly investigate this, and if we can reach a sound determination about what happened, what the Russians did, the different levers the Russians pulled. We know the Russians used a variety of techniques to interfere in elections in Europe. We know they used some of those techniques here, and we want to find out about everything the Russians did. \u201d Schiff was later asked, \u201cCan you say with confidence at this point, that it is premature for people to say there\u2019s going to be no proof of collusion?\u201d He responded, \u201cYes. It\u2019s certainly premature. And one of the challenges we have, Chris, in the investigation is, there are the members of the gang of eight in the committee that have received certain information, and then there\u2019s the rest of the committee members. And what I\u2019ve been urging the FBI is to share the information that the gang of eight has received with the full committee, so that we\u2019re all on the same page, we\u2019re all doing the same investigation, but that\u2019s an issue that has yet to be resolved. \u201d (  RCP Video) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"

      "content": "Democratic candidates will take the stage at the CNN Center in Atlanta on Wednesday night to make a final appeal as to why they should become the next Democratic National Committee chair. [The event will reportedly air live on CNN, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, CNN International, CNNgo, Westwood One Radio Network and on CNN Channel 116 on Sirius XM.  CNN said the debate will focus on the candidates\u2019 \u201cstrategies for the 2018 midterm elections, rebuilding the Democratic Party and the DNC\u2019s role under the Trump administration. \u201d According to CNN, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley dropped out of the race last week, taking the number of candidates down to six from seven. Buckley threw his support behind Rep. Keith Ellison ( ). In addition to Ellison, the other candidates are former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally   and television commentator Jehmu Greene. \u201cTo receive an invitation to the debate, a person must be recognized by the DNC as a candidate for chair as outlined by its 2016 memo and must have appeared in at least three of the four DNC\u2019s Future Forums held in Phoenix, Arizona Houston, Texas Detroit, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland,\u201d CNN wrote. Although CNN did not officially announce which candidates will participate in Wednesday\u2019s debate, Heavy. com reported: The Phoenix Future Forum was attended by Keith Ellison, Tom Perez, Sally Boynton Brown, Ray Buckley, Pete Buttigieg, Jehmu Greene, and Jaime Harrison. The Houston forum was attended by 10 candidates, including Buttigieg, Perez, Ellison, Greene, Harrison, Peter Peckarsky, Buckley, Brown, and Vincent Tolliver. The Detroit forum was attended by 10 candidates (Vincent Tolliver was booted from the forum after criticizing Ellison\u2019s faith, The Detroit News reported.) Other candidates who attended included Ellison, Buckley, Harrison, Boynton, and Buttigieg. Candidates who attended the Baltimore forum included Perez, Ellison, Buckley, Buttigieg, and six others. The new chair will be voted on and announced on Saturday, February 25. The winner will take over from interim leader Donna Brazile, who stepped in for Debbie   after she resigned in July following the release of a series of damaging WikiLeaks emails that showed her and the Democratic Establishment colluding against Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) to rig the primary for Hillary Clinton. Ellison and Perez are considered the leading candidates for the DNC chair position. Ellison has attracted the support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) while Perez has received endorsements from former Vice President Joe Biden,  Virginia Gov. Richard \u201cTerry\u201d McAuliffe and Colorado Gov. John Wright Hickenlooper among others. The difference between both candidates and their list of endorsements appears to signal the growing, and divisive, internal battle within the Democratic Party between centrists and progressives. Democratic party leaders have expressed concern with the extreme and aggressive approach radical progressives have exhibited in lobbying for Ellison. The Minnesota congressman is seen as a hard leftist. In December, emeritus law professor at Harvard University, author and Orthodox Jew Alan Dershowitz, said if Ellison is elected as DNC chair he would resign from the Democratic Party. Dershowitz said in an interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s Mornings with Maria Bartiromo: If they now appoint Keith Ellison, who worked with Farrakhan, to be chairman of the DNC, you\u2019re going to see a lot of people leave. I\u2019m going to tell you right here on this show, and this is news, if they appoint Keith Ellison to be chairman of the Democratic party, I will resign my membership to the Democratic party after 50 years of being a loyal Democrat. I will still vote my conscience and mostly I will vote for Democrats, but I will not be a member of a party that represents itself through a chairman like Keith Ellison, and through policies like that espoused by John Kerry and Barack Obama. Wednesday\u2019s DNC chair debate will air at 10 p. m. EST (7 p. m. PST). Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz"

[The fan of Milo, whose book Dangerous reached #1 on Amazon\u2019s best sellers list within a day of being made available to   this week, claims that her First Amendment rights were infringed after she was forced to evacuate Milo\u2019s speech   in February when a   protest turned into a violent riot.  \u201cThe suit, filed in federal court in California on Monday alleges that the defendants \u2018have subjected UC Berkeley students and invitees who do not subscribe to the radical, left wing philosophies sanctioned by Defendants to severe violence and bodily harm for merely expressing a differing viewpoint, in clear contravention of their rights under the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution,\u2019\u201d reported SF Gate on Tuesday. \u201cIn addition to the UC Berkeley Regents, the suit\u2019s many defendants include UC president Janet Napolitano, the UC Berkeley police department, the Berkeley police department, frequent conservative target George Soros and California representative Nancy Pelosi. \u201d In the lawsuit, the fan claims that \u201cThe University of California Berkeley (\u2018UC Berkeley\u2019)   \u2026     has acted to unconstitutionally curtail the First Amendment rights of its students and invitees thereof. \u201d \u201cSeveral people, including Plaintiff Robles, were intentionally and violently attacked by both masked and unmasked assailants and the UC Berkeley campus incurred over $100, 000 worth of damage,\u201d the suit continues. \u201cPlaintiff Robles was attacked with extremely painful pepper spray and bear mace by masked assailants amongst the \u2018protestors\u2019 because she chose to exercise her right to freedom of speech and show support for the planned speaker, Milo Yiannopoulos. \u201d In addition, the lawsuit also claims no campus police were around to defend students, attendees, and the speaker when violence from protesters started to erupt. \u201cNearly 100 campus police and SWAT members waited in the Student Union building, within eyesight of the violence happening outside, watching the protestors become more belligerent and dangerous,\u201d the suit claims, adding that the defendants \u201cshould have been fully prepared\u201d for violence from   protesters. \u201c \u201d from   groups started several fires, smashed windows and ATMs, looted downtown stores, attacked cars, and assaulted dozens of Milo fans, male and female, who they falsely accused of being \u201cNazis\u201d during the riot on February 1. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that rioters caused around $100, 000 in damages at UC Berkeley, while the damage to downtown Berkeley was reported to be around $400, 000 to $500, 000. An organizer for the   group BAMN called the violent Berkeley riot against Milo \u201cstunningly successful,\u201d before warning that MILO could expect the same response should he return to the city.

      "publication": "Breitbart",
      "author": "James Delingpole",
      "date": "2017-04-21",
      "content": "The Competitive Enterprise Institute has released a video urging President Trump to keep his campaign promise and withdraw the U. S. from the Paris climate agreement. [It features a speech President Trump gave in May 2016 explaining exactly why he wanted to pull out:  \u201cThis agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over our energy and how much we use right here in America. No way!\u201d He adds: \u201cWe\u2019re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of the United States\u2019 tax dollars to UN global warming programs\u201d. The video concludes: Mr President. Don\u2019t listen to the Swamp. Keep your promise. Withdraw from the Paris climate treaty. Send it to the Senate. Now, however, he appears to be having second thoughts. His administration is reportedly divided on the issue, with White House insiders including Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arguing for the U. S. to remain inside the UN Paris agreement, supposedly in order to keep a \u201cseat at the table. \u201d That would make it more expensive than a solid gold,   seat at the table of King Croesus then. In fact, it would make it  \u2014   at $65 trillion  \u2014   the most expensive seat at the table in the history of the world. And the $65 trillion, by the way, is a conservative estimate. This  \u2014   according to calculations by Bjorn Lomborg  \u2014   is the lower end estimate of how much it would cost the world if all the signatories of the Paris climate agreement stuck to their CO2 reduction commitments. First, Bjorn Lomborg, accepting   advocates\u2019 assumptions about how much warming comes from carbon dioxide, showed in a   study that implementing all provisions of all signers to Paris would prevent only 0. 306 degrees Fahrenheit of global warming by 2100. What would it cost? Unofficial estimates by the United States, European Union, Mexico and China amount to $ $757 billion per year. All told, $ $946 billion. Per year. Every year from 2030 to the end of the century. \u201cAnd that\u2019s if the politicians do everything right. If not, the real cost could double,\u201d Mr. Lomborg said. So, for $ $132 trillion, we might  \u2014   if the alarmists are right  \u2014   reduce global average temperature by a third of one degree by 2100. That\u2019s $ $431 billion per thousandth of a degree of cooling. But if you think things just couldn\u2019t any more stupid, wait till you hear what the effect of pouring all that money down the drain on futile   reductions schemes will have on the state of the Earth\u2019s climate. Here is what a   study by Bjorn Lomborg says. It will, by 2030, reduce \u201cglobal warming\u201d by the almost immeasurable 0. 048 degrees C. And by the end of the century, it will reduce \u201cglobal warming\u201d by 0. 17 degrees C. This, of course, depends on the heroic assumption that all the signatories to the Paris agreement stick to their carbon dioxide emissions targets. Which they won\u2019t a) because the targets aren\u2019t legally binding or in any way enforceable and b) many countries  \u2014   including the biggest polluter China  \u2014   just don\u2019t give a damn anyway: as far as they\u2019re concerned, these UN climate targets are just a handy way of shackling idiot Western nations with regulations and maybe grabbing a bit of Western  . Which very much suggests that President Trump\u2019s first instincts were right: there is no logical reason as to why the US should pay even lip service to this ludicrous climate agreement  \u2014   signed off by President Obama in the dog days of his failing administration, without Congressional approval. That he is wavering on the issue now can, therefore, clearly not be excused as the hesitancy of a man who has studied the evidence more closely and been persuaded that to remain in the Paris agreement is the rational course of action. Rather, it is further depressing evidence that President Trump is being got at by members of his inner circle who would prefer him to maintain the establishment status quo  \u2014   however wrongheaded and counterproductive  \u2014   than to fulfil his promise to drain the swamp. When this administration finally makes its decision on this issue  \u2014   it was due on Tuesday but the meeting was cancelled because the president had other appointments  \u2014   we will be closer to answering one of the great questions of our time: who is going to win the battle for the soul of Trump presidency  \u2014   the people or the swamp?"

The acquisition will firmly move the online retail behemoth into the realms of both the    business as well as grocery.  Amazon will gain over 460 stores nationwide  \u2014   including more than 80 in the state of California. And its presence will put major pressure on other groceries as Amazon is expected to use its considerable online retail muscle to create a giant network of food delivery service. \u201cThe    market as we know it is a dinosaur,\u201d Phil Lempert, the food trends editor for NBC\u2019s Today, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThis is going to be a great shot in the arm for the industry. \u201d Amazon currently has a small grocery delivery arm named AmazonFresh. It\u2019s a   grocery delivery service offered to only the company\u2019s Prime members for a monthly fee of $14. 99 and available in about just 20 U. S. cities. With the acquisition of Whole Foods, \u201cthis adds 440 refrigerated warehouses within 10 miles of probably 80 percent of the population,\u201d Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cMore importantly, it puts refrigerated distribution within 10 miles of probably 95 percent of Prime members. That means we can rely upon Whole Foods\u2019 consistently high quality meat and produce, and can rely upon prompt delivery from the store as a distribution point. \u201d But make no mistake, the Whole Foods clientele, like Amazon\u2019s Prime membership, is very much affluent and mostly urban and suburban. Ordinary Americans don\u2019t necessarily crave quinoa salad with a side of   dressing for lunch. It\u2019s the reason Whole Foods was for sale in the first place, as the supermarket chain, derisively dubbed \u201cWhole Paycheck\u201d by some, has struggled to compete  \u2014   even with other organic outlets such as Trader Joe\u2019s. The bigger picture is that for Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, it\u2019s just another piece of his  . Amazon is adding its own logistics network, which was responsible for 43 percent of all online sales in the U. S. last year (while accounting for just 0. 2 percent of the grocery and food market share). \u201cWe will take all the capacity that the U. S. Postal Service can give us and that UPS can give us and we still need to supplement it,\u201d Bezos said at Recode\u2019s 2016 Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, according to Bloomberg. \u201cSo we\u2019re not cutting back. We\u2019re growing our business with UPS. We\u2019re growing our business with the U. S. Postal Service. \u201d And with Whole Foods\u2019    stores, Amazon will soon have a   apparatus for its delivery service in some of the nation\u2019s most affluent markets. Pretty soon, you can indeed pick up some kale with that cellphone battery if you don\u2019t want to have either dropped off at your front porch. Follow Samuel Chi on Twitter @ThePlayoffGuru."

[\u201cU. S. Code, U. S. law, is absolutely explicit. 8 U. S. Code 1182 says it is the president\u2019s decision if there is a national security need, to limit, to vet, to even stop the immigration of individuals from certain countries,\u201d Gorka pointed out.  \u201cWe inherited  \u2014   this is the irony  \u2014   from the Obama administration a list of nations that were of greatest concern, where there is the caliphate, where there is terrorism. We used that analysis to issue two executive orders, and they have been attacked for overt political reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an attempt made to make these seem as if there was some underhand ulterior motive to do with Islam itself, or to do with a certain racial group, when, of course, that cannot be true  \u2014   because if there were any dread motives, then the fact that the largest Muslim nation, Indonesia, the largest Arab nation, Egypt, are on neither of the executive orders proves the point that this is purely about national security,\u201d he contended. Gorka reported that the latest update on the case is that the Department of Justice has requested to the Supreme Court that they \u201chear this case, this attempt to block our executive order, as soon as possible. \u201d \u201cHopefully, that will be the case, Raheem,\u201d he told SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam. Kassam mentioned the novel legal theory deployed against the executive order that Trump\u2019s rhetoric on the campaign trail a year ago invalidates his exercise of presidential authority by revealing dark motives at odds with the White House justification for the travel ban. \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern that we\u2019ve been witnessing now for twenty weeks. It\u2019s very strange,\u201d Gorka said of this reasoning. \u201cI was on CNN for my sins last week and I had to discuss for 16 minutes with the host one tweet by the president, as if a tweet is a policy statement or an executive order,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI think it\u2019s just clutching at straws. I think it\u2019s desperation. The campaign trail is not U. S. policy, so I think it\u2019s desperation on their behalf, and that\u2019s why I think we will succeed. \u201d Kassam asked if there was any truth to rumors that President Trump would cancel or delay his upcoming state visit to the United Kingdom following a disastrous election for Prime Minister Theresa May. \u201cI really have to use this opportunity, Raheem, to bolster the \u2018Breitbart is the factual purveyor\u2019 reality,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the horse\u2019s mouth: the prime minister\u2019s office gave a public statement. The queen, Queen Elizabeth, has issued an invitation to the President of the United States. Nothing has changed since that invitation was sent to the White House. Those are the facts of the matter. \u201d Kassam described it as the latest false   story to generate headlines for a few days, only to be quietly corrected later when the leakers turn out to be wrong. \u201cHow is it that they get away with this stuff when if we made one tiny little spelling error or typographical error on Breitbart News, I don\u2019t hear the bleeding end of it?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t even think the moniker \u2018fake news\u2019 is sufficient at the moment. I think we really have to talk about propaganda,\u201d Gorka observed in response. \u201cBut your point is well taken. The lack of consequences for the left in their media has led to the reality where most voters simply don\u2019t care. Look at viewing figures for CNN. Look at how the finances of newspapers like the Washington Post  \u2014   they have to be saved by billionaires because they\u2019re simply not viable in the private market. \u201d  \u201cYes, there are double standards, but eventually, at the end of the day, who\u2019s listening to them? Just that echo chamber that Ben Rhodes was so proud of creating,\u201d he said, referring to President Barack Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, who has boasted of his ability to manipulate the media. Gorka said the White House planned to spend the coming days talking about economic growth and some big foreign policy stories, such as the diplomatic crisis surrounding Qatar. \u201cJust look at the stock market, look at the U. S. economy. Finally, people are being unfettered, small businesses are being allowed to function in ways that actually make them money and not the government,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the national security front, the Qatar situation is fascinating,\u201d he observed. \u201cThe president goes to the heart of the Muslim world. He asks for action. Action is taken, and now we have to see the sponsorship of terrorism end. That\u2019s a big one for me, Raheem. \u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. "

[In total, 54, 944 illegal aliens either had their Temporary Protected Status (TPS) renewed by the administration or are new recipients of the classification, which has been derided by immigration hawks for being an indirect amnesty program.  Under Temporary Protected Status, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens are allowed to remain in the U. S. for up to 18 months, as Breitbart Texas reported. After their protected status has expired, they can   to have the classification renewed. Although the number of illegal aliens receiving protected status remains high, the Trump Administration did lower the number, which encompasses January through March 2017, from where the Obama Administration had left it. In Obama\u2019s last full three months in office, DHS approved close to 84, 000 illegal aliens for temporary protected status. But while Trump\u2019s DHS does not look to be considerably destabilizing the program, Rep. Mo Brooks ( ) introduced legislation to halt the Temporary Protected Status system. \u201cMy bill, the TPS Reform Act, would ensure that \u2018temporary\u2019 means temporary by establishing clear time limitations and creating statutory tests that must be met to grant the TPS designation,\u201d Brooks said in an interview about the program. \u201cThis legislation provides the needed reform for what has become a   amnesty program. \u201d Days ago, Breitbart Texas reported how border crossings along the U.

      "content": "  congressmen stood in front of the Capitol  \u2014   along with Janet Porter, the Ohio woman who led the fight for passage of that state\u2019s \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d  \u2014   all in support of Rep. Steve A. King (R. ) and his Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017, H. R. 490, which restores legal protection to unborn children once their pulse is detected. [\u201cIt is a profound religious and moral understanding that every human person has the right to life,\u201d said King, who was joined by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R. ) Rep. Trent Franks (R. .) Rep. Scott G. Perry (R. .) and Rep. Don Bacon R. .) along with other prolife supporters of the bill.  \u201cThe question that has hung before the courts, since 1973 is: \u2018When does life begin?\u2019 \u2014  we all know when that is,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cWe stand here and assert that it has to be a distinctive moment. You can\u2019t guess a thing called viability. You can\u2019t say 22 weeks versus 20 weeks. You have to say it is at a specific instant. The most precise instant that we can describe and that we can identify by science is the moment that that heartbeat begins,\u201d he said. \u201cThe core tenet is this: If a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected,\u201d he said. King, who is the chairman of the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, said the only exception to the protection for the unborn in the bill is for those circumstances when the life of the mother is in physical danger. Abortionists who violate the law would face up to five years in prison, he said. The bill was filed Jan. 12 and was referred to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration. Porter, who is the founder and leader of Faith2Action, told Breitbart News she started fighting for the Ohio heartbeat bill on St. Valentine\u2019s Day 2011, and in December it passed the Ohio House and Senate, but it was vetoed by Gov. John Kasich. The governor signed a bill that protected unborn children at the   mark, which is about the point when the child has the nerve development to feel pain, she said. \u201cHe signed the pain bill, which saves 125 babies every year, but he vetoed the heartbeat bill that would have protected 20, 000 every year,\u201d she said. The heartbeat bill is set to be   in the Ohio legislature this year. \u201cWe had the votes to override, but unfortunately, not every Republican was willing to return from their Christmas vacation to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are reintroducing the bill in Ohio it has also been introduced in 17 other states. It has passed in three, Arkansas, North Dakota and Ohio. \u201d The support for the bill is now sufficient for the concept to go national with a federal law, she said. \u201cJust four days ago, we heard President Trump say that we are going to make America safe again. What this bill does, what the heartbeat bill will do is make America safe again \u2014  the first step is to make America safeid for every child with a heartbeat,\u201d she said. Porter told Breitbart News the idea for a federal law came out of a conversation she had with King at Phyllis Schlafly\u2018s funeral in September. \u201cI remembered the words that Phyllis told me about Congressman King, how much she respected and revered him \u2014  and I do as well he is a leader who will not compromise,\u201d she said. Father Stephen Imbarrato, a pastoral associate of Priests For Life, told Breitbart News he expects the heartbeat bill to be very controversial on Capitol Hill. \u201cI really feel that these difficult bills that we have been hesitant to bring forward in the past are such an opportunity for us to educate the constituents, the people of American, about what is really going on in terms of killing our unborn brothers and sisters in the womb and actually wounding the hearts of so many women,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be a difficult fight, but it is a fight that we have to have,\u201d he added. Larry Cirignano, the Washington representative of the Children First Foundation  \u2014   the group behind \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plates in New York, Washington, New Jersey, and Connecticut that raise money for adoptions  \u2014   told Breitbart News he is encouraged by President Donald J. Trump\u2019s embrace of the   agenda and he is sure the president would sign the bill. \u201cPresident Trump has said we have to be bold and we have to get away from this idea that we can protect an infant after it\u2019s born alive or when it feels pain \u2014  all the incremental steps \u2014  every baby, every day should be protected,\u201d he said."

      "content": "Three asylum seekers who are suspected of setting an asylum centre on fire in the German town of   in January are now on trial for arson. [The trio of asylum seekers, aged between 20 and 26, are said to have been \u201cfrustrated\u201d with their accommodation at the asylum home which was converted from a former military barracks. They are said to have made threats to the workers at the home the day before claiming that if they didn\u2019t have their demands fulfilled there would be a \u201cmassacre\u201d Tag 24 reports.  Among their demands was to be moved to a different facility and they told the workers that they had been in conflict with other asylum seekers who came from Albania. The prosecution states that two of the men, who are also brothers, smashed up the furniture in one of the rooms and then proceeded to light it on fire. The two brothers say that they did smash the furniture but left the room and only returned to discover the fire. The third defendant has refused to testify in the case. As a result of the blaze which led to severe damages to the asylum home, 57 residents were injured. Of those injured 27 were immediately released while 30 others were taken to the hospital, one with serious injuries. Thr asylum home was specifically set up for migrants from the Balkan region who were unlikely to receive an approved asylum claim. Though the home has space for around 900 migrants, only 500 were living at the facility at the time of the fire. Several asylum homes across Germany have a similar issue in that they have space for many more migrants than they actually house. In some cases, it means the average cost of housing the migrants has soared because the homes expected full capacity and are locked into long contracts to feed, clothe and provide security. In one town 21 asylum seekers were costing the local government 500, 000 euros per month. Migrants setting their own accommodation on fire is also not uncommon. In Dusseldorf, a migrant set a massive fire at the city\u2019s exhibition centre because he was angry about not being woken up for breakfast during Ramadan last year. Two migrants in G\u00f6\u00dfweinstein in Upper Franconia also set fire to their asylum home, though the act was thought to be caused by negligence. Two Syrian asylum seekers were smoking a hookah water pipe which uses coals that are thought to have caused the blaze which caused 100, 000 euros worth of damage."

[A sheriff\u2019s deputy arrested Andrew Humphries, 18, after police found him walking along South U. S. Highway 441 naked Wednesday following a car crash, WTSP reported.   Police responded to a report of a crash on Highway 441 and Southeast 81st Street when they learned one of the drivers left the scene. According to a video of the incident, a deputy found Humphries strolling along the highway and asked the man to come to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, man? Why are you naked?\u201d the deputy asked. \u201cWere you in that accident up the road there?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Humphries responded. Humphries then walked over to the car and tried to open the locked driver\u2019s side door. The deputy then cuffed him and put him inside the car. \u201cLet me explain to you why you\u2019re in cuffs: you tried to open up the door of a police car,\u201d the deputy told Humphries. \u201cSo, something\u2019s going on with you that you\u2019re doing stuff that\u2019s not normal. \u201d \u201cIn addition to that, you are absolutely naked, my man  \u2014   another thing not normal,\u201d the deputy added.

Humphries allegedly \u201ckicked the rear passenger door and pulled on the metal cage. \u201d Police estimate the vehicle suffered $1, 000 in damage. Deputies took him to Marion County Jail and charged him with two counts of criminal mischief, one of them a felony count for property damage of $1, 000 or more and the other a misdemeanor. The Florida Highway Patrol, which was investigating the crash Humphries was involved in, reports that witnesses say Humphries tried to open the door and pulled off the handle of a parked car at the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s   Office. He also allegedly urinated on the vehicle after he discovered he could not get in. The Miami Herald reports that the estimated damage to the other vehicle was about $700. The Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the crash separately from the charges, the sheriff\u2019s office said."

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "date": "2017-02-05",
      "content": "Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz wrote Saturday that President Donald Trump had respected the independence of the judiciary by appealing, rather than ignoring, a federal judge\u2019s injunction against his executive order on immigration. [While Dershowitz, a noted Democrat and civil libertarian, was critical of Trump for calling Judge James L. Robart a \u201c  judge\u201d on Twitter, he observed that there was a distinction between Trump\u2019s words and his actions.  Dershowitz wrote in Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail: President Donald Trump avoided a constitutional crisis by appealing, rather than defying, an overbroad injunction against his visa executive order issued by a federal judge in Washington State. Justice James Robart\u2019s injunction is   in effect, despite another federal judge in Massachusetts having rendered a decision refusing to renew a similar injunction, and thus allowing the visa restrictions to be implemented. In light of these conflicting rulings, the President could have said that he was going to follow the one he and his lawyers believed was correct. Had he done so, the judge in Washington might well have held the President in contempt of court, thus creating a constitutional crisis between   branches of our government.   \u2026     Whatever one thinks about the merits or demerits of Justice Robert\u2019s injunction  \u2014   or of the Massachusetts Federal Judge\u2019s refusal to renew the injunction  \u2014   we are observing in action the American system of checks and balances, and separation of powers. Conservatives frequently criticized President Barack Obama during his two terms in office for attacking the judiciary in public. The most notorious example was during his 2010 State of the Union address, when he criticized the Supreme Court for its Citizens United ruling  \u2014   with six justices seated in front of him and the whole nation, unable to utter a response. Obama also warned the Supreme Court publicly not to overturn Obamacare during the two cases where that had been a possibility. In 2012, after oral arguments went badly for him, Obama even questioned the power of judicial review itself. The Obama administration also developed a bad habit of defying federal courts  \u2014   first in Louisiana, where it continued a moratorium on   oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico despite court orders to allow drilling to continue and later in Texas, where the administration defied a judge\u2019s order to suspend the \u201cexecutive amnesty\u201d program, and misled the court. During the 2016 presidential campaign,   Trump faced criticism from both conservatives and liberals for comments about the   judge presiding over the Trump University fraud case, which was recently settled.

      "content": "Andrew Marantz of the New Yorker gives a platform to establishment reporters whinging about how President Donald Trump is changing the White House\u2019s interactions with the press. It\u2019s not about their egos and seating charts, they feel the need to protest  \u2014   they just \u201cdon\u2019t appreciate diversity of journalistic practice. \u201d (? ??) [From The New Yorker:  Major Garrett, the chief White House correspondent for CBS News, sits in the front row. \u201cHistorically, the way the briefing room has been organized is, the closer you are, the farther you\u2019ve come,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cAnd the person at the podium has tended to recognize that. \u201d More experienced reporters, he said, \u201cask questions that are sharper, more informed. Not, \u2018What\u2019s your message today?\u2019 Not, \u2018Here\u2019s a paintbrush \u2014  would you paint us a pretty picture?\u2019 \u201d If established reporters got fewer questions relative to the floaters, I asked, would this be good or bad for democracy? \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged in a grand experiment. \u201d A TV correspondent told me that calling on   reporters first isn\u2019t just about appealing to their egos: \u201cIt\u2019s also about maintaining a sense of predictability, a sense that eventually the substantive questions will be answered. Throwing that into chaos \u2014  \u2018Maybe you\u2019ll get a question, if you shout loud enough, who knows?\u2019 \u2014  makes everyone desperate and competitive and makes us look like a bunch of braying jackals. Which I don\u2019t think is an accident. \u201d About once a week, the walls behind the lectern are turned   revealing   screens from which reporters around the country can ask questions by video link. This is another Spicer innovation \u2014  the \u201cSkype seats. \u201d Recent Skype questions were allotted to a Trump supporter and newspaper owner in Kentucky, who asked about reducing   regulations, and to a   host named Lars Larson, who addressed the press secretary, an officer in the Navy Reserve, as \u201cCommander Spicer,\u201d before asking whether the Administration would privatize federally protected parkland. During one of these sessions, Jared Rizzi, a White House correspondent for Sirius XM, tweeted, \u201cSkypeophant (n.)  \u2014     questioner used to burn up briefing time through the magic of   technology. \u201d \u201cI certainly appreciate the purpose of bringing geographic diversity into the room,\u201d Rizzi told me. \u201cI also appreciate ideological diversity. I don\u2019t appreciate diversity of journalistic practice. \u201d A longtime Washington reporter from a mainstream network echoed that sentiment. \u201cI don\u2019t mind them bringing in conservative voices that they feel have been underrepresented,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t even mind them fucking with the   guys, the Jonathan Karls of the world. Those guys are a smug little cartel, and it\u2019s fun to watch them squirm, at least for a little while. But at what point does it start to delegitimize the whole idea of what happens in that room? When does it cross the line into pure trolling?\u201d Read the rest of the story here. Update, possibly unrelated :  It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better!  \u2014   Donald J.

      "title": "Father and son fight FAA over weaponized drone",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "",
      "date": "2016-07-06",
      "content": " (CNN) A Connecticut judge heard arguments on Wednesday over whether the constitutional rights of two men who equipped a drone with weapons and posted videos to YouTube will be violated if a federal agency were to investigate them.  Austin Haughwout, 19, of Clinton, and his father, Bret Haughwout, shot two videos depicting a handgun and a flamethrower attached to a drone. After the videos were posted to YouTube an investigation was launched by local police, who later determined the father and son didn\u2019t violate any local laws.  The U. S. attorney\u2019s office has since issued subpoenas on behalf of the Federal Aviation Administration but the Haughwouts have not complied with them, arguing the subpoenas violate their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and questioning. U. S. District Judge Jeffrey Meyer, who will make a decision as early as next week, stated the biggest issue at hand in this case is the distinction between the FAA\u2019s authority to investigate and their authority to enforce the laws. Assistant U. S. Attorney John Larson argued that the FAA has jurisdiction over any craft used and designed to fly in navigable airspace and that drones fall under this category.  Larson went on to say that in this case the FAA simply wants to conduct an investigation because all they know about the armed drone is what they see in the videos and that the drone has the potential to be flown into the national airspace system. Meyer posed several questions to the government about what the FAA has the authority to regulate and used an example of a car going airborne after taking a jump. \u201dThe FAA will not have jurisdiction over a car jump . .. there has to be more of a consistent use. There is nothing today that allows a car to sustain flight,\u201d Larson said. Meyer also asked whether a craft that is flying six inches above the ground is subject to FAA regulation.  \u201dYes, your honor. That is the FAA\u2019s position. Any use for flight constitutes grounds for air regulation,\u201d Larson said. Defense attorney Mario Cerame argued in court the FAA needs to say why drones need to be regulated. He argued on his client\u2019s behalf that the agency lacks the authority to regulate recreational drones. Meyer gave both sides a deadline of Monday, July 11, to file any additional documents and anticipates making a decision by next week. Austin Haughwout is facing other legal battles as well. Last week he was arrested and charged with enticing a minor with a computer and possession of child pornography. He was arraigned on those charges last week.  A CNN request for comment from Haughwout\u2019s lawyer representing him in that case, Jon L. Schoenhorn, was not immediately returned, but he told the Hartford Courant the arrest warrant \u201doverly broad\u201d and contained \u201dnothing shocking.\u201d "

      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "Deirdre Walsh",
      "date": "2016-07-06",
      "content": "Washington (CNN) FBI Director James Comey\u2019s scathing criticism of Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information gave new ammunition to congressional Republicans already critical of the Democratic nominee\u2019s private email use, and is now prompting an effort to ban her from any future top secret briefings. House Speaker Paul Ryan argued that Comey\u2019s findings justified the move to ban her access to classified information, telling reporters on Wednesday, \u201dI think it\u2019s the least we can do, given how she was so reckless in handling classified material and sending classified information on insecure servers.\u201d But Democrats accused Republicans of playing election year politics with the issue. Since the FBI decided against charging Clinton, Democrats declared her exonerated and said the brouhaha over the emails was \u201dover,\u201d in the words of a Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.  Republicans don\u2019t agree, and on top of calling Comey to a   hearing on Capitol Hill on Thursday and demanding all the details of his probe, they are exploring other options. A conservative member of the House Intelligence Committee told CNN he and others on the panel are considering how they can prevent Clinton or others who have been irresponsible with classified material from having access to it. \u201dAs a first step, I think anybody who has been deemed to have been excessively careless with national security information should automatically have access to national security information revoked,\u201d Kansas GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo told CNN. He said Republicans on the committee were looking at legislation and argued there \u201dshouldn\u2019t be any discretion, should be a carte blanche rule. These are important American secrets. This isn\u2019t about politics. This is about keeping America safe.\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes didn\u2019t go as far as Ryan and Pompeo, telling CNN the panel has some information, but he was asking the FBI to turn over all the classified materials so they could review it before deciding next steps. But the California Republican noted that those who have clearances but violate the rules about releasing it are typically denied any further access.  \u201dSo if you mishandle information, the first thing that happens to you is you can no longer handle information until there has been an investigation. And if you consider what they did, you look at what her staff did, from what we can see right now    we don\u2019t have all the information    if you apply that same logic to someone who is working for the Department of Defense or working for the CIA or working for the House Intelligence Committee, they\u2019re gone. They\u2019re done. They\u2019ll never hold a clearance again.\u201d A message left with the Clinton campaign was not immediately returned Wednesday afternoon. Typically, both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees get classified briefings from the intelligence community on the top national security issues of the day. Some Democrats have complained that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump cannot be trusted with secret information. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seized on the FBI director\u2019s statement to suggest that Clinton may have lied to the FBI about her handling of the emails and said the public has a right to know exactly what she told investigators. \u201dThere is no particular penalty for lying to the public, unless the public gets tired of it, but there is a real penalty for lying to the FBI,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said at a news conference. \u201dThe question here is Hillary Clinton and her public explanations compared to her private representations to the FBI. We\u2019re entitled to know all that. The American people would like to have the answer to that.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, the    Senate Republican, called on Comey to release the full details of the FBI\u2019s probe.  \u201dIf she wants to begin to recover her shredded reputation, it\u2019s important to get the facts out to the American people,\u201d Cornyn said.  Democrats dismissed Republicans\u2019 calls as more political posturing. \u201dThe Republicans are in such desperate shape because of Trump they will seize on anything,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Reid told reporters. \u201dIt\u2019s over. It\u2019s time to move on.\u201d Rep. Steve Israel,   York, echoed Reid. \u201dThis is just par for the course,\u201d Israel told reporters. \u201dThey tried it on Benghazi, they are trying it on this. This is what the Republicans do. The only jobs they create are jobs for people who hand out subpoenas and their investigations of Democrats.\u201d"

      "title": "Cristiano Ronaldo fires Portugal past Wales and into Euro 2016 final",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "",
      "date": "2016-07-06",
      "content": " (CNN) Cristiano Ronaldo proved himself the man for the big occasion once again by firing Portugal into the final of Euro 2016 Wednesday. Ronaldo\u2019s   header and a strike by his former Manchester United teammate Nani secured a   win against Wales in Lyon. Portugal, which last reached the final of the competition in 2004, will face either host nation France or world champion Germany in Paris on Sunday. This contest had been billed as clash between two of the world\u2019s top players    Ronaldo and his Real Madrid teammate Gareth Bale. But Bale, who has enjoyed a stellar tournament for a country which had never before qualified for the tournament, failed to match the exploits of his rival. Ronaldo, who equaled Michel Platini\u2019s record of scoring nine career goals at the Euros, will now hope to exorcise the ghosts of 2004 when Portugal was beaten by Greece in a final held in its own backyard.  \u201dI hope that [after the final] we\u2019ll be smiling and that it will be tears of joy in the end,\u201d Ronaldo told the tournament\u2019s official website. \u201dI\u2019ve always said my dream was to win a trophy with Portugal. We\u2019re closer to doing it and I believe that we\u2019ll win.  \u201dWith a lot of work, humility and the spirit of   which I have always shown in my career, these sorts of things are doable.\u201d Rocky road, For Portugal, the road to the final has been long and arduous, often due to the team\u2019s own inadequacies. While Wales enjoyed a rather enchanting run to its first major semifinal, Portugal\u2019s journey to its fifth could scarcely have been more different. No other team had arrived at the   stage of the European Championship finals without winning a game in 90 minutes    but Portugal, which drew all three of its group matches and only qualified in third place, has always managed to do just enough. A   win over Croatia, secured with just three minutes of   remaining, was then followed by a penalty shootout triumph over Poland after the game had finished  . For all the exciting talent, and there is plenty even if this may not be a vintage Portuguese team, rarely has it looked impressive. And yet, what it has done, is use its experience, its   and a resolute determination to ensure it will not be beaten. In Renato Sanches, an    midfielder recently bought by Bayern Munich for $36 million, Portugal has a player who will surely go on to take on Ronaldo\u2019s mantle. But even the youngest and most precocious need guidance. That guidance has come from Ronaldo, who despite failing to find his best form, has carried this team for long periods of the tournament. His two goals in the   draw with Hungary, a game in which it trailed on three separate occasions, enabled Portugal to qualify as the third of the four best   teams. \u201dIt\u2019s what we have dreamed of since the beginning,\u201d Ronaldo added. \u201dWe knew it would be a long road and we\u2019re still in the tournament. We have believed right from the start.  \u201dWe had difficult moments, but it\u2019s like I always say: it\u2019s better to start poorly and have a positive ending.  \u201dWe haven\u2019t won anything yet as I said a few days ago, but the dream is still alive.\u201d Leader, For so long Ronaldo has been the one who has been responsible for pushing his team forward, but even he has appeared to be struggling both on and off the field of play. First there was his outburst after his side\u2019s group draw against Iceland, when he accused the island team of having a \u201dsmall mentality\u201d and claiming it would never achieve anything in the tournament    a prediction which proved rather wide of the mark. Then there was his penalty miss in the goalless draw with Austria which was followed a few days later by his decision to throw a reporter\u2019s microphone into a lake while out on a prematch walk. But for all his histrionics and his ability to split public opinion, few can doubt his talents and the records he has broken. His 61 goals in 132 games makes him Portugal\u2019s top scorer, while he is the only player to have scored in four consecutive European Championship finals. But his struggles in France have been well documented    his wayward shooting, the lack of usual poise on front of goal and his waning influence on games has become more noticeable. It is in sharp contrast to his Real Madrid teammate Bale, who was responsible for creating one of the only real opportunities of a tight and cagey first period. Bale, who scored in each of Wales\u2019 first three group games, picked the ball up in his own half and drove through the Portuguese midfield before unleashing a fierce effort straight at goalkeeper Rui Patricio. Turning point, While the first half may have been rather uninspiring, the second was anything but as Ronaldo and Portugal took control of the contest. Just five minutes of the second half had passed when Ronaldo rose highest at the far post to meet Raphael Guerreiro\u2019s cross and power a header into the top corner. Wales, still dazed from conceding the opening goal, was then dealt another blow just three minutes later. Once again it was Ronaldo at the heart of the move, flashing a driven effort into the penalty area    and Nani, who on Tuesday joined Valencia, diverted the ball past stranded goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey. Wales, pushing forward in search of a way back into the contest, began to leave holes at the back and was fortunate not to fall further behind. First, Hennessey failed to hold Nani\u2019s shot and Joao Mario somehow contrived to fire the rebound wide of the post with the goal gaping. Moments later it was Danilo who came close, his short squirming under Hennessey\u2019s body before the goalkeeper recovered to stop the ball on the line. Wales huffed and puffed, with Bale unleashing a couple of efforts from long range as Portugal sat back and hit its opponent on the counter attack. Roared on by thousands of fans, Wales continued to move forward but it lacked the precision and quality which had been so evident during its run to the final four. In the immediate aftermath of this defeat, it is easy to to forget that when Chris Coleman took over this team four years ago that it sat 117th in the world rankings and had not qualified for a major tournament since 1958. Just to play in these finals was an achievement    but what this team has done over the past month will change the landscape of football in Wales forever. Not only did it qualify ahead of England and outlast it, it played with a sense of pride, passion and least of all, quality. Some had labeled Wales a \u201d  team\u201d with Bale cast as the superstar dragging 10 other players along with him. Yet, such an assertion was to prove folly.   Read more: Full Euro 2016 coverage, Wales have been a joy to watch throughout the tournament. Like Iceland, it boasts a connection between the team and supporters which few others can match, bar the Irish of course. It has inspired, it has brought hope and it has revitalized football in the country    but this was a fairy tale without the ending so many had yearned for. For Ronaldo, though, the end is not yet written."

      "date": "2016-07-06",
      "content": "Washington (CNN) Donald Trump\u2019s campaign on Wednesday announced it raised $51 million since late May, a sign that his first major fundraising foray has proved moderately successful. The haul is likely to calm some fears that Trump will be unable to compete financially with Hillary Clinton, who has spent tens of millions of dollars on ads while Trump raised his first dollars. But Trump still starts in a deep hole compared to her    he had only $1. 3 million on hand as of June 1    and the new figures nevertheless reveal that he will be substantially dependent on the Republican National Committee. Clinton\u2019s campaign announced last week it had raised $68 million in June for her campaign and joint fundraising committees. But unlike Trump, most of that cash went to her official campaign, giving her more control over how to spend it. Trump raised $26 million via   fundraising, and $25 million from 22 fundraisers for his joint fundraising committee, the campaign said. The lion\u2019s share of the online money will go to Trump\u2019s official campaign, and a heavy majority of the joint committee cash will head to the RNC.  The campaign did not specify how much would go to each group, or how much was raised in June as opposed to the last week of May. The RNC spends its cash not purely on presidential politics    as Trump\u2019s campaign would    but rather on helping the entire Republican ballot. Trump personally contributed $3. 8 million to his campaign as well, bringing the total to $55 million. He did not reveal an updated    figure, a key piece of data that he will be required to share as part of a federal elections report later this month. \u201dThe results from this month show the enthusiastic movement the campaign has created. People want to invest in a better future for America and Make America Great Again! The campaign very much appreciates the broad support,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. Later Wednesday afternoon, Trump appealed to his Twitter followers for donations, tweeting, \u201dTo all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary.\u201d Trump only started fundraising in earnest in late May, and his national fundraising schedule took him from Texas to Arizona to West Virginia in the month of June. His campaign has struggled to attract top bundlers, and he is expected to trail Clinton by at least $500 million in total dollars raised. Yet his digital operation remains a sign of promise: His campaign claimed that one of his fundraising emails collected $2 million at once, and a powerful   operation backed by his most fervent supporters could help close the gap with Clinton. And Trump is expanding his   network, too. The Trump campaign and the RNC announced this month that they are adding about 85 fundraising veterans to their operation. Trump\u2019s fundraising shop previously consisted publicly of only about 20 people. Trump\u2019s campaign said it attracted more than 400, 000 supporters, with 94% of them giving less than $200. Full details of Trump and Clinton\u2019s June fundraising numbers must be reported to the Federal Election Commission by July 20."

Manning, 28, is currently serving a   prison sentence for her role in leaking government documents to WikiLeaks.

      "publication": "CNN",

      "content": " (CNN) When investigators combed through the charred remains of the Fisher family\u2019s burned down home in Scottsdale, Arizona, they uncovered evidence of a shocking triple murder.  It was April 10, 2001. Someone had cut the throats of Mary Fisher and her two children, Brittney, age 12 and Bobby, 10. Mary Fisher also had been shot in the back of her head.  The remains of all three victims were found in their beds. A natural gas line in the house had been severed. Someone poured a flammable liquid throughout the home to make the fire spread faster, lit a candle and then left.  Ten hours later, the home exploded and burned to the ground.  What was left of Mary Fisher and the children\u2019s bodies was barely recognizable. Mary Fisher\u2019s husband, the children\u2019s father  \u2014   Robert Fisher, was nowhere to be found.  \u201dAll signs pointed to Robert Fisher as the suspect,\u201d Scottsdale police Detective Hugh Lockerby told CNN\u2019s \u201dThe Hunt with John Walsh.\u201d Friends and neighbors said the couple had been having problems.  \u201dThey did not have a happy marriage,\u201d said Wade Rencsok, a former neighbor. Police believe Mary Fisher was going to leave Robert and divorce him. But Robert Fisher, who\u2019d suffered through his own parents\u2019 divorce as a teen,  \u201dwasn\u2019t going to let that happen,\u201d Lockerby said.  Robert Fisher made his living as a respiratory tech at a medical clinic. Before that, he\u2019d worked as a firefighter and served in the Navy, where he\u2019d tried out  \u2014   and failed  \u2014   to join the Navy SEAL program.  People who knew him said Fisher could be aggressive and controlling. He\u2019d been a hunter and outdoorsman since he was a young adult.  Friends told stories about Fisher\u2019s odd behavior  \u2014   like when he killed an elk and then smeared its blood over his body.  Or the time during a fishing trip when he was seen swimming across a lake holding a Bowie knife in his teeth.  Investigators suspected Fisher had set his house on fire to destroy evidence of the killings and perhaps to fake his own death.  But a house fire wasn\u2019t going to cover up the bullet that was lodged in Mary Fisher\u2019s head. \u201dFires don\u2019t burn bullets,\u201d said retired Scottsdale police detective TJ Jiran. A neighbor said they heard the couple arguing the night before the fire. Based on that, police guess the murders took place between 9:30 p. m. and 10:15 p. m.  At 10:43 p. m. Robert Fisher appeared on an ATM camera, along with Mary Fisher\u2019s Toyota 4Runner.  Then 10 days after the house fire, the 4Runner was discovered parked empty in a remote pine forest northeast of Scottsdale. Police suspected Robert Fisher was hiding out in the area\u2019s mountains, canyons and caves.  SWAT teams along with search and rescue units were called in to scour the area. \u201dWe did not find any evidence of Robert Fisher there,\u201d Lockerby said. \u201dWe believe that he had some sort of alternate means to leave the area.\u201d Jiran said he spoke to a witness \u201dthat possibly saw\u201d Fisher walking north on a road near where the 4Runner was discovered. \u201dIs he living up there in the woods right now? Is he really that survivalist? Who knows what these guys do when they run?\u201d Jiran said.  Fifteen years later, the mystery remains unsolved. Is Robert Fisher dead? Or has he been successfully dodging police and the FBI? Fisher was relatively young at the time of the house fire  \u2014   39 years old. Now he would be 54  \u2014   much older, with more physical limitations.  \u201dI can\u2019t picture Robert being alive and not contacting us for [so many] years,\u201d said Robert Fisher\u2019s sister Jean Rountree. \u201dSo I have to believe there\u2019s another answer out there.\u201d Fisher has been on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted List since 2002. \u201dWe\u2019ve tracked leads all over the world, but none have panned out,\u201d said Lockerby.

Everybody heard it. You could hear it in the house next door. And you never really heard him scream, which is kind of weird. I mean he had a way about him, but you never heard him scream. You always heard his wife screaming. Things like, \u2019You\u2019re worthless. I could have done better than you. We should get a divorce. \u2019\u201d The fugitive\u2019s sister, \u201dIf he was found alive that would give us answers,\u201d said Fisher\u2019s sister Jean Rountree. \u201dBecause the only option if he was found alive is that he did do it.\u201d"

      "content": " (CNN) Occasionally Donald Trump says something that is politically incorrect but which also happens to be true.  On Tuesday at a campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump defended the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein\u2019s record on terrorism, saying, \u201dHe was a bad guy    really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so well. They didn\u2019t read them the rights. They didn\u2019t talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.\u201d  Defending the brutal Iraqi dictator who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people isn\u2019t exactly fashionable. But if you consider the 13 years of war that have wracked the country    in which a quarter of a million have died    and add that Saddam brutally repressed all dissent, including groups such as al Qaeda, and also add to this that ISIS is itself a fruit of the Iraq War, it\u2019s a far more defensible position.    Trump didn\u2019t offer any evidence for his assertions about Saddam\u2019s brutal repression of terrorist groups or of Saddam \u201dkilling terrorists,\u201d but his observations about the dictator are an implicit critique of the George W. Bush administration\u2019s erroneous claims before the Iraq War that Saddam was allied to al Qaeda. Those claims were an essential element of the case that the administration made to go to war, since Saddam\u2019s supposed connections to al Qaeda were the only purported evidence that he might give his putative weapons of destruction to terrorists.  The centerpiece of the Bush administration\u2019s case for going to war in Iraq was Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s presentation to the U. N. Security Council on February 5, 2003, six weeks before the invasion. Powell\u2019s presentation was a bravura performance that seemed to establish beyond a doubt that Saddam was actively concealing an ongoing weapons of mass destruction program and was in league with  .   At one point the secretary of state dramatically brandished a small vial of a white powder of supposed anthrax, saying \u201dabout this amount. ..shut down the U. S. Senate in the fall of 2001.\u201d As Powell gave his speech, sitting directly behind him was CIA director George Tenet, giving a visual imprimatur to what Powell was saying.   One section of Powell\u2019s UN speech tried to make the case for an emerging alliance between Saddam and  :  \u201dIraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab   an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his   lieutenants. ..When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp, and this camp is located in northeastern Iraq. .. He traveled to Baghdad in May of 2002 for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.\u201d Five weeks before the invasion of Iraq, CIA director Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that Iraq had \u201dprovided training in poisons and gases to two   associates,\u201d a point that Powell had also made in his U. N. presentation.  What the American public did not know about Tenet\u2019s and Powell\u2019s crucial claim about Iraq training   associates on poison gases was that it didn\u2019t show a nexus between bin Laden, Saddam and some of the world\u2019s nastiest weapons. Instead, it was the tainted fruit of an \u201dextraordinary rendition\u201d in which militants were transported by American officials to countries that routinely used torture, where they would supposedly finally divulge whatever secrets they had been keeping from their American interrogators. In December 2001 Ibn al Shaykh al Libi, a Libyan militant who had run an    training camp, was captured in Pakistan. Libi told his FBI interrogators that there were no ties between Saddam and  . Several days into his interrogation the CIA then rendered Libi to Egypt, where jailors were known for subjecting their prisoners to beatings, electric shocks and sexual assaults.  To improve his chances of better treatment once in Egypt, Libi told his interrogators that bin Laden had sent two operatives to Iraq to learn about biological and chemical weapons.   Because Libi\u2019s story encapsulated the key arguments for the Iraq war, his tale was picked up by President Bush in a keynote speech in Cincinnati on October 7, 2002 in which he laid out his rationale for the coming conflict with Iraq, saying, \u201dWe\u2019ve learned that Iraq has trained   members in   and poisons and deadly gases.\u201d  But once he was back in American custody, on February 14, 2004, Libi recanted what he had falsely told his Egyptian interrogators. Libi told his U. S. interrogators that he had \u201dfabricated\u201d his tale of the     connection to the Egyptians following \u201dphysical abuse and threats of torture.\u201d Two and a half years into the Iraq war, in October 2005, the CIA released a report that finally disposed of the myth that Saddam and the leader of   in Iraq, Zarqawi, had ever been in league, assessing that prior to the war, \u201dthe regime did not a have a relationship, harbor, or turn a blind eye towards Zarqawi.\u201d   Since the fall of Baghdad no documents have been unearthed in Iraq proving the    axis despite the fact that, like other totalitarian regimes, Saddam\u2019s government kept meticulous records. The Defense Intelligence Agency had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from Saddam\u2019s Iraq and found there was nothing to substantiate a \u201dpartnership\u201d between Saddam and  . Two years later the Pentagon\u2019s own internal think tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) concluded after examining 600, 000   documents and several thousand hours of his regime\u2019s audio and video tapes that there was no \u201dsmoking gun (i. e. direct connection between Saddam\u2019s Iraq and  . )\u201d  Join us on Facebook. .  In June 2008 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded, as every other investigation had before, that there was no \u201dcooperative relationship\u201d between Saddam and  . The committee also found that \u201dmost of the contacts cited between Iraq and  \u2019ida before the war by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined not to have occurred.\u201d  Also on Wednesday, after a   investigation, the British inquiry into the Iraq War known as the Chilcot report was released. It found that before the war British intelligence repeatedly assessed there was no connection between Iraq and al Qaeda.  Trump is likely not a student of the English political philosopher Hobbes, who wrote his masterwork \u201dLeviathan\u201d in the shadow of the English Civil War. But he seems to have grasped Hobbes\u2019 main point: that an absolute \u201dsovereign\u201d (i. e. dictator) was preferable to \u201dthe war of all against all\u201d that characterized the civil war in   century England as well as much of the civil war that continues to wrack   century Iraq.  And Trump\u2019s claim that following the fall of Saddam, Iraq has emerged as the \u201dHarvard\u201d of terrorism is correct because Zarqawi in 2004 merged his terrorist group with al Qaeda to create \u201dAl Qaeda in Iraq,\u201d which is the parent organization of today\u2019s ISIS."

      "author": "Gregory Krieg",

      "content": " (CNN) From Vladimir Putin to Saddam Hussein, President Donald Trump has a long history of regularly and openly expressing admiration for a rogues\u2019 gallery of foreign dictators and authoritarians. Trump\u2019s soft spot for strongmen was on display again Monday, when he phoned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to congratulate him on winning a referendum designed to dismantle the country\u2019s democratic infrastructure. In fairness, Erdogan pushed back on Tuesday, conceding in a CNN exclusive interview that his death    \u201dI am a mortal, I could die at any time\u201d    would end his rule.    The White House readout of the call made no mention of the ongoing crackdown in Turkey, where Erdogan has targeted opposition figures, journalists and other elements of civil society in the aftermath of a failed coup last year. A senior Trump administration official told CNN the call skirted the controversy surrounding the referendum and, apart from a \u201dsimple congrats,\u201d mostly focused on Syria. Some vocal segments of the domestic political establishment and   pundits responded to news of the conversation with shock and dismay. But if anyone is surprised, well, then they obviously haven\u2019t been paying much attention the past two years    or weeks, for that matter.  Fourteen days earlier, Trump celebrated Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   another Middle Eastern autocrat, during a White House meeting in which he promised a \u201dvery long and strong relationship.\u201d He then tweeted a scrapbook\u2019s worth of photos documenting the visit. For Trump, the recipe is simple. If his counterparts are committed to fighting ISIS and complimentary of the President personally, then the conversation all but stops there. (Note: This is not uncommon in the annals of American diplomacy. Trump\u2019s predecessors regularly backed assorted autocrats and dictators, though rarely with such gusto.) Again, this shouldn\u2019t come as breaking news. Hillary Clinton discussed it at some length during the 2016 campaign.  \u201dI will leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his attraction to tyrants,\u201d she said during a speech last June. Among those unsavory figures to have enjoyed a place in Trump\u2019s good graces: Saddam Hussein, While Trump is hardly alone in suggesting   regime change has done more harm than good in the Middle East, his assessment of Hussein\u2019s crimes sounds almost approving.  \u201dSaddam Hussein throws a little gas, everyone goes crazy,\u201d he said in December 2015, dismissing a March 1988 poison gas attack that killed more than 5, 000 Kurds living in northern Iraq. About 15 months later, Trump would order missile strikes on the Syrian regime, one his administration had signaled just days earlier it had no plans to contest, in response to a chemical attack on its own people.  In an October 2015 interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Trump praised Hussein. The former Iraqi leader \u201dwould kill the terrorists immediately,\u201d he said, \u201dnow it\u2019s the Harvard of terrorism.\u201d Trump revived the Ivy League comparison in July 2016. After calling Hussein \u201da bad guy,\u201d he added: \u201dBut you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn\u2019t read them the rights. They didn\u2019t talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.\u201d Kim Jong Un, Like with the   and executed Iraqi dictator, Trump in January 2016 first called North Korea\u2019s Kim a \u201dmaniac,\u201d then riffed with some awe on the young despot\u2019s bloody rise to power. \u201dYou have to give him credit,\u201d Trump said.  \u201dHow many young guys    he was like 26 or 25 when his father died    take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden    you know, it\u2019s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture and it\u2019s a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, and he\u2019s the boss. It\u2019s incredible. He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one. I mean, this guy doesn\u2019t play games. And we can\u2019t play games with him. Because he really does have missiles. And he really does have nukes.\u201d A few months later, the Obama administration added Kim\u2019s country to its sanctions list for human rights abuses. \u201dUnder Kim Jong Un, North Korea continues to inflict intolerable cruelty and hardship on millions of its own people, including extrajudicial killings, forced labor and torture,\u201d Adam J. Szubin, a top Treasury Department official, said in a statement.  Trump has since adopted a stricter line with Pyongyang. On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, \u201dThe era of strategic patience is over,\u201d effectively dispensing with the international consensus on how to best deal with North Korea and its nuclear capabilities.  The reversal comes after what Trump has called a successful first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who as the President recalled took \u201d10 minutes\u201d to explain why the North Korean situation is \u201dnot so easy.\u201d Moammar Gadhafi, Trump often paired the former Libyan dictator with Hussein during the campajgn as a means of attacking Clinton, who voted in the Senate to authorize military force against the Hussein and backed military intervention against Gadhafi during her turn as secretary of state. When Libya emerged as a second home to ISIS fighters flushed out of Syria and Iraq, he offered plainly, \u201dwe would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.\u201d \u201dIf these politicians went to the beach and didn\u2019t do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we\u2019d be    at least they killed terrorists, all right,\u201d he said during a GOP primary debate. \u201dAnd I\u2019m not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re getting,\u201d he continued, adding the usual caveat. \u201dYou look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it\u2019s a total mess.\u201d Gadhafi ruled Libya from September 1969 up until his killing by rebel forces following the   intervention in 2011. His repressive regime killed thousands of its own people and, for decades, was a leading state terror sponsor. Vladimir Putin, Over the course of a campaign and young presidency spent promising to reclaim America\u2019s standing in a world Trump claims has come to mock it, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin    a former Soviet KGB officer turned autocratic president    repeatedly emerged as a kind of beacon.  \u201dHe\u2019s running his country and at least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country,\u201d Trump said on MSNBC in December 2015, a day after Putin, in his annual press conference, called the billionaire \u201dan outstanding and talented personality\u201d who had emerged as \u201dthe absolute leader of the presidential race.\u201d It wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first time praising the Russian leader. After recalling with some pleasure that they had once appeared on the same highly rated episode of \u201d60 Minutes,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 \u201dFace the Nation\u201d in October 2015 that a meeting could be fruitful.  \u201dI think that I would at the same time get along very well with him,\u201d Trump said of Putin. \u201dHe does not like Obama at all. He doesn\u2019t respect Obama at all. And I\u2019m sure that Obama doesn\u2019t like him very much. But I think that I would probably get along with him very well. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be having the kind of problems that you\u2019re having right now.\u201d Trump\u2019s bromantic inclinations toward Putin have been tempered over the past couple months, as the probe into Russia\u2019s alleged election meddling festered, and then in the aftermath of the Syrian chemical attack. But even as he conceded last week that   relations \u201dmay be at an   low,\u201d he is still holding out hope. \u201dIt would be wonderful,\u201d Trump said at a joint press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, \u201dif NATO and our country could get along with Russia.\u201d Benito Mussolini, Trump stopped short of endorsing Mussolini\u2019s governing style, but couldn\u2019t deny his attraction to a quote widely attributed to the World War   Italian fascist leader and staunch ally of Adolph Hitler. In February 2016, the candidate retweeted a parody account created by a Gawker writer that had assigned the line to Trump himself: \u201d@ilduce2016: \u2019It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.    @realDonaldTrump\u201d Hours later, on NBC\u2019s \u201dMeet the Press\u201d host Chuck Todd asked Trump, \u201dDo you like the quote? Did you know it was Mussolini?\u201d \u201dSure,\u201d Trump replied. \u201dIt\u2019s OK to know it\u2019s Benito Mussolini. Look, Mussolini was Mussolini. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s a very good quote. It\u2019s a very interesting quote. And I saw it and I know who said it. But what difference does it make, whether it\u2019s Mussolini or somebody else?\u201d"

      "title": "Will Rio Games really be a catastrophe?",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "",
      "date": "2016-07-06",
      "content": " (CNN) A month to go before the Olympic Games get started, and reports have emerged of a new   bacteria growing in the waters around Rio de Janeiro. The news is yet another cause for concern for the world\u2019s athletes and spectators alike. But are these Games, as some seem to suggest, doomed to failure? Certainly, the last thing Rio needed on top of worries about crime and infrastructure was another headline about the possible health risks of going to these Games. After all, long before Brazilian scientists flagged two beaches near where sailing events are scheduled to take place as harboring this superbacteria, the presence of raw sewage in the water had been on the minds of sailors, some of whom wonder if merely closing their mouths while competing will be enough.  Rio may have vastly improved its sewage treatment processes, but problems obviously remain, and neither the Rio organizing committee nor the International Olympic Committee has given any indication the events will be moved to safer waters. The superbacteria reports come on the back of even bigger concerns about the   Zika virus, which has prompted a handful of athletes to take their names out of Olympic consideration. Last month, for example, cyclist Tejay van Garderen let go of his Olympic dreams over concerns about the harm it might do to his pregnant wife if he contracted Zika.  Meanwhile, many of the world\u2019s top golfers, including Vijay Singh, Jason Day, and Rory McIlroy, have also withdrawn, dimming much of the fanfare of the return of the sport to the Olympic program for the first time since 1904.  Golfers might indeed look like the perfect prey for Rio\u2019s mosquito population, playing for extended periods on a newly created course in the Marapendi Natural Reserve, which contains plenty of water hazards. But some athletes who play indoors have also decided to take to the bench for various reasons, including some of the NBA\u2019s biggest stars. Steph Curry cited injuries from a long season, rather than Zika, as his reason for sitting out, while newly minted champion LeBron James has merely said he wants to rest.  Other athletes, such as U. S. soccer goalie Hope Solo, have said they will simply make sure they are protected, staying indoors as much as possible.  The South Korean team has issued \u201d \u201d uniforms to its athletes, while tennis great Serena Williams has assured fans she will stay safe but that she will play. According to the World Health Organization, the seasonal shift has greatly lowered the number of Zika cases in Brazil. But has the damage already been done to this Olympics? True, Rio has had more than its share of familiar host city setbacks, from unfinished venues to striking workers.  The financial fragility of the country, in particular, led the city to declare \u201da state of public calamity.\u201d  Civil police workers, their wages in peril, have been greeting visitors at the airport with giant banners reading \u201dWELCOME TO HELL\u201d and warning people that they will not be safe while in the city.  Headlines regarding stray bullets, body parts washing up on Copacabana Beach, and seemingly incessant muggings do little to suggest anything other than a disaster waiting to happen. But it is important to remember that the Olympic Games have survived much in their history, from the displays of white supremacy at Hitler\u2019s Olympics in 1936 in Berlin, to the stray dogs that plagued Sochi in 2014.  And walking around the Olympic Park in Athens just days before the opening ceremony in 2004 is unlikely to have given anyone much confidence that anything organized could take place there. The list of Olympic crises goes on and on. No, if these Olympic Games are really to be called a \u201dcatastrophe,\u201d as some, including in The New York Times, have already done, it will more so be for those who live in Brazil than those who visit for a few weeks.  When the Olympic cauldron is lit in one month\u2019s time, eyes will turn to the historic swims of Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky, tennis rosters that include the top five men and women in the world, and the hamstring of Jamaica\u2019s Usain Bolt, who after pulling out of his country\u2019s trials has flown to Germany to try to rehab in time for competition.  Join us on Facebook. . Ultimately, though, the Olympics are not going to bring an end to the problems Brazil has faced. There will, of course, be the pomp and pageantry of the opening and closing ceremonies.  There will be records of human achievement laid down in the pool and on the track (and, if all goes as it should for Simone Biles, in the gymnastics pavilion). But even as the Olympics provide moments that cut through and distract from many of the problems and concerns with moments of greatness, it is important to remember that the Olympics are also a window into the world in which we live. Rio, with its water and its mosquitoes and its crime, is very much a part of that world.  Setting aside a relative handful of athletes, the city has extended an invitation to which, despite these challenges, most have said \u201dyes.\u201d "

      "title": "Louisiana draws blue line in wrong places",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "",
      "date": "2016-07-06",
      "content": " (CNN) The war in our communities continues. Tuesday night, 37 year old Alton Sterling was shot dead by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He is the latest of many black and brown Americans who have died at the hands of police playing the role of judge, jury and executioner. Although protesters have taken to the streets to demand accountability, they will likely be disappointed, and like other demonstrators in places like Ferguson or Baltimore, dismissed as racist or causing a surge in violence. Officers and lawmakers will, as they have in the past, shun \u201dblack lives matter\u201d to embrace \u201dall lives matter\u201d or \u201dblue lives matter\u201d instead.  This incident in Baton Rouge, about which details are still unfolding, is additionally significant because Louisiana, in particular, has made it clear that it\u2019s more interested in protecting police officers than vulnerable minority communities. In May, the governor signed a new law that makes assaulting a police officer a hate crime. Harming a police officer is thus no different from harming a member of a minority community.  Other states have celebrated the law and will soon follow Louisiana\u2019s example because they believe cops are under siege. But as we saw last night in Baton Rouge, the real war is against minority communities, not police officers. How this law misreads \u2019message crimes\u2019 Hate crime laws should generally extend only to vulnerable Americans who are targeted on the basis of their personal identity. Making police officers a protected class is just the latest effort to avoid police accountability and obscures the violence that minority communities continue to endure at the hands of police and the broader American public. Hate crime laws are designed to protect minority communities who are targeted because of a personal characteristic, such as race, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Historically, these communities have been vulnerable to violence and therefore need heightened protection under the law. These laws are also necessary because hate crimes are different from other crimes. They would never occur absent the victim\u2019s personal identity. Attacking a gay club, vandalizing a mosque, confiscating a disabled person\u2019s wheelchair are \u201dmessage crimes.\u201d They\u2019re meant to intimidate and inflame and lead to lasting trauma for the victims and their communities. Now think about violence against police officers. Unlike minority communities, police officers are not particularly susceptible to hate violence. Instead they\u2019re cloaked in immense power. U. S. police officers are among the most   and trained in the world, and often have ready access to   military equipment used abroad. They\u2019re also taught to never hesitate, which is why they\u2019re afforded so much discretion under the law and so rarely indicted by the courts. The evidence confirms their  . FBI data shows that violence against police is rapidly declining and that 2015 was a particularly safe year for law enforcement. Nor is assaulting a police officer a message crime. Officers assume the risk of violence when they join the service and are trained to respond to violence with lethal force. Consider how police officers respond to targeted violence versus minority communities. Law enforcement exercises unflinching force and authority when one of its own is under threat minority communities often recoil and feel isolated. There\u2019s likewise little precedent for making an occupation a protected class under a hate crime statute. If we add police officers, then why not also add lawyers, doctors, and all public servants? States that wish to provide greater protection to their officers can always promulgate independent laws that enhance the criminal penalties for assaulting an officer. Many states already have such laws on the books, including Louisiana, which makes its new law all the more extraneous. In search of police accountability  It\u2019s clear that Louisiana and the states that will soon follow in its footsteps believe there\u2019s a war on cops in America. FBI Director James Comey has championed this perspective and decried the \u201dYouTube world,\u201d \u201dmobile phone cameras,\u201d and \u201dviral videos\u201d lamented the \u201dchill wind blowing through law enforcement\u201d and repeatedly emphasized that \u201dall lives matter.\u201d Citizens who seek police accountability aren\u2019t waging a war on cops, though they\u2019re seeking justice. Social media, smartphones and the like have revolutionized all manners of social encounter, not just   ones.  These technologies are an important check on police abuse, and have helped spur a national conversation on police overreach and lethal force, including President Obama\u2019s Taskforce on 21st Century Policing. We need more police accountability, not less. Consider that the FBI still doesn\u2019t have a fully transparent and reliable mechanism for collecting and disseminating the total number of civilians killed by police, information that every American has the right to know. Similarly, while all lives do matter, colorblindness has proven disastrous for  . Our collective refusal to pay attention to race and bias has blinded us to the inequities that   face in almost every facet of American life, including employment, housing, public education, and police violence. \u201dBlack Lives Matter\u201d is in part an effort to abandon colorblindness and explicitly inject race into American public discourse. In fact, Black Lives Matter activists may find themselves on the receiving end of a particularly perverse application of the new Louisiana law.  A protester who raises his elbows when confronted by a cop could be charged with a hate crime and assault. Those who protest at a police station could be charged with a hate crime and trespass.  Join us on Facebook.  In contrast to police officers, minority communities, in particular transgender, black and brown Americans, remain acutely vulnerable to violence in its many forms. In 2015, 1, 134 people lost their lives at the hands of police, with young black men nine times more likely to be killed than other Americans.   are more likely to be stopped, arrested, and prosecuted than their white counterparts, and face more severe penalties as well. Countless more were the victims of police brutality or militarization, like we saw in Ferguson.  It\u2019s not just police. There are 892 hate groups nationwide, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Hate crimes against transgender Americans tripled between 2013 to 2014 and continue to rise. Islamophobia is higher now than after   and in the months after the San Bernardino tragedy, Sikh and Muslim Americans experienced a 200% and 300% uptick in hate incidents. A similar increase is likely in the wake of the Orlando tragedy and other recent acts of violence. Hate is efflorescing in this country, but it\u2019s directed at minority communities, not police officers. Our hate crime laws should reflect this painful reality    not a mythical war on cops."

      "title": "Republicans hit Comey over Clinton email probe, say issue isn\u2019t over",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "Stephen Collinson",

      "content": "Washington (CNN) Americans have not heard the last of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Republicans pumped FBI Director James Comey Thursday for fresh evidence to prolong the politically damaging saga during a Capitol Hill hearing that ignited partisan anger over his decision not to seek charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. GOP lawmakers vented frustration that Clinton escaped criminal action over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state while Democrats blasted the hearing as no more than a   funded  . The     hour hearing, however, appeared to eke out several new seams for Republicans to pursue. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said he would ask the FBI to probe whether Clinton lied to Congress over her email arrangements. The agency, Comey said, did not investigate Clinton\u2019s testimony before the House Benghazi panel last year because Congress had not asked it to. \u201dI think when you come to Congress you need to provide truthful testimony and if you don\u2019t provide truthful testimony there should be a consequence,\u201d Chaffetz told reporters after the hearing. \u201dI thought the FBI was looking at this, but evidently, they\u2019re not. They weren\u2019t looking at it.\u201d Comey also testified that while people copied on Clinton emails had security clearances, some contractors who maintained the server and lawyers who examined her emails did not. Republicans tried to build an impression that Clinton repeatedly misled the American public over her motives and use of the private server system    something Republicans hope will highlight questions about her trustworthiness. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy asked Comey a series of questions rooted in the former secretary of state\u2019s statements on the issue. \u201dSecretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails, either sent or received. Was that true?\u201d Gowdy asked. \u201dThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Comey replied. \u201dSecretary Clinton said, \u2019I did not   any classified material to anyone on my   there is no classified material.\u2019 Was that true?\u201d Gowdy went on. \u201dThere was classified material emailed,\u201d Comey replied. As the politicians played for the cameras, Comey sat unruffled, vigorously defending the FBI probe and explaining why the presumptive Democratic nominee escaped indictment even though he had fired off a withering critique of her handling of classified information on Tuesday. \u201dI think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent    that I could establish,\u201d Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform panel. \u201dWhat we can\u2019t establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent.\u201d While Comey was the witness, Clinton was clearly the target of the hearing as Republicans seek to keep the controversy over her email setup alive to highlight her most glaring vulnerability heading into November\u2019s election, questions about her character and honesty. \u201dThere is no consequence, director    there is no consequence,\u201d Chaffetz said, demanding to know why Clinton and her aides do not appear to be paying a price over the   controversy. \u201dWe are mystified and confused by the fact pattern that you laid out and the conclusions that you reached,\u201d said Chaffetz, adding that \u201dthe Average Joe\u201d would have been led off in handcuffs had they done what Clinton did. Trump meets with more than 200 House Republicans, Comey also testified that there were three emails found on Clinton\u2019s servers bearing the letter \u201dC\u201d which denotes they were classified, in apparent contradiction of the former secretary of state\u2019s statements. But he said it was not clear whether Clinton knew that such a designation denoted classified material, saying \u201dthe secretary may not have been as sophisticated as people assume\u201d when it comes to such issues. But Comey testified that Clinton did not lie to the FBI during their year long probe which culminated with her interview with bureau agents on Saturday and explained that the agency did not want to \u201dput people in jail unless we can prove they knew they were doing something they shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d And, following Attorney General Loretta Lynch\u2019s announcement Wednesday that she would accept the FBI\u2019s findings and close the case, Comey explained the legal distinction that underpinned his decision not to seek charges. \u201dMy conclusion was and remains that no reasonable prosecutor would bring . .. the second case in 100 years for gross negligence,\u201d Comey said. He explained that under relevant statutes, prosecutors would have to prove Clinton clearly knew she was breaking the law to win a case. \u201dShould have known, must have known, had to know, does not get you there,\u201d he said. The Clinton campaign argued after the hearing that it had been a mistake for Republicans to put Comey, a former prosecutor who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Republican administration, on the spot. \u201dIf you were a House Republican sitting on the panel today, you probably felt like that hearing backfired,\u201d Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on CNN\u2019s \u201dThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\u201d arguing that the GOP had tried to use the hearing to create a \u201ddrip, drip\u201d of coverage that would keep the issue in the news. Fallon also said that all of the lawyers who sorted Clinton\u2019s emails did in fact have security clearances, contradicting Comey\u2019s comments. And asked whether Clinton had lied to Congress, Fallon replied: \u201dOf course not.\u201d Committee Democrats spent the hearing portraying the whole affair as yet another attempt by Republicans    following the House Select Committee on Benghazi    to use the mechanics of government to wound their presidential nominee. \u201dIn their eyes, you had one job    and one job only    to prosecute Hillary Clinton,\u201d the Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, told Comey. \u201dBut you refused, so now you are being summoned here to answer for your alleged transgressions.\u201d Hours after Comey\u2019s hearing, the State Department announced it had reopened its probe into Clinton\u2019s email use, an investigation that will focus on whether current employees involved in handling or sending and receiving Clinton\u2019s emails should get disciplinary action. The department had suspended its probe while it was waiting for the Justice Department to complete its criminal investigation. As the drama unfolded in a House hearing room, Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump was elsewhere on Capitol Hill, meeting GOP House and Senate lawmakers. Clinton was also in Washington Thursday, huddling with senior advisers at her home just off Embassy Row. Republicans are trying other avenues to keep the email controversy that has clouded her presidential campaign for months, alive. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for instance, asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to block access to classified briefings for Clinton for the rest of the campaign.  Trump, Rubio fundraise off Comey\u2019s testimony, Trump sent out a fundraising email during the hearing, complaining that the FBI had let Clinton \u201doff the hook.\u201d \u201dWe know the FBI refused to hold Lying Crooked Hillary accountable. But working together, we can hold her feet to the fire,\u201d Trump wrote. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sent out a similar solicitation for his   bid, arguing that the email saga proved Clinton was unfit to serve as President. \u201dIf Hillary becomes president, this will not be the last scandal the American people will endure,\u201d Rubio warned."

      "content": "Warsaw, Poland (CNN) President Barack Obama said early Friday that Americans should feel outraged at episodes of police brutality since they\u2019re rooted in   racial discord. Speaking in Warsaw immediately after landing here for a NATO summit, Obama called the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile \u201dtragedies\u201d and demanded that the country as a whole \u201ddo better.\u201d Confronting issues of race and violence yet again after a spate of similar incidents during his presidency, Obama delivered a   argument that   are more likely to suffer at the hands of law enforcement. Citing statistics showing minorities are more likely to be pulled over, searched or shot at by police, Obama said it was incumbent on the country to aim for better    including recognizing   biases that must be \u201drooted out.\u201d \u201dIf communities are mistrustful of the police, that makes those law enforcement offers who are doing a great job, who are doing the right thing, that makes their lives harder,\u201d Obama said, insisting that recognizing problems within law enforcement doesn\u2019t equate to being  . \u201dWhen people say \u2019black lives matter,\u2019 it doesn\u2019t mean that blue lives don\u2019t matter,\u201d Obama said, referring to police officers. \u201dBut right now, the data shows that black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents. There is a particular burden that is being placed on a group of our fellow citizens.\u201d Obama addressed reporters assembled in a makeshift hotel briefing room after a   transatlantic flight on Air Force One. He spoke just before 1 a. m. local time, the urgent timing underscoring Obama\u2019s deeply felt opinions on the subject, which he\u2019s spoken about at length after police brutality incidents in Ferguson, Missouri, Baltimore and South Carolina. The shooting deaths in Louisiana and Minnesota this week were partially captured in cell phone videos that quickly went viral and sparked renewed discussions about fatal police force against  . \u201dWhen incidents like this occur, there is a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if because of the color of their skin they are not being treated the same. And that hurts. And that should trouble all of us,\u201d Obama said in his statement. \u201dThis is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue. All   people should be concerned.\u201d Hours earlier, Obama used his Facebook page to comment on the shootings. \u201dWe\u2019ve seen such tragedies far too many times, and our hearts go out to the families and communities who\u2019ve suffered such a painful loss,\u201d Obama wrote on his Facebook page.  He said he was \u201dencouraged\u201d that the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. But, he wrote, \u201dRegardless of the outcome of such investigations, what\u2019s clear is that these fatal shootings are not isolated incidents. They are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year, and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve.\u201d He continued, \u201dTo admit we\u2019ve got a serious problem in no way contradicts our respect and appreciation for the vast majority of police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us every single day. It is to say that, as a nation, we can and must do better to institute the best practices that reduce the appearance or reality of racial bias in law enforcement.\u201d He concluded his statement by saying all Americans should \u201drecognize the anger, frustration and grief that so many Americans are feeling\u201d over the shootings. \u201dMichelle and I share those feelings,\u201d Obama wrote. Vice President Joe Biden also weighed in Thursday, saying he has \u201dmore anger I share with the country\u201d over the incidents.  \u201dMore black lives lost. More anger I share with the country. More broken trust we have to restore. We all must do this,\u201d Biden tweeted.  Earlier Thursday, video surfaced of a police officer in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, fatally shooting Castile, an   man, during a traffic stop. Sterling, 37, died earlier in the week after a police shooting in Baton Rouge."

      "title": "Super Typhoon Nepartak slams Taiwan",
      "publication": "CNN",

      "date": "2016-07-07",
      "content": " (CNN) Super typhoon Nepartak made landfall in Taiwan early Friday, about 15 kilometers south of the eastern city of Taitung, tearing roofs off buildings, flipping cars and dumping rain across the island.  So far, three deaths and 142 injuries have been reported by the Taiwan Central Emergency Operations Center after the typhoon packed winds of up to 240 kph (150 mph). The storm hammered the eastern coast of Taiwan with torrential rain and wind for several hours prior to arrival, with photos on social media showing cars destroyed by the onslaught. Taiwan\u2019s rugged and mountainous terrain has slowed Nepartak, which has been downgraded from a super typhoon to a typhoon by Friday lunchtime. Forecasters say the storm will leave Taiwan by late Friday and will hit eastern China early Saturday local time.  More than 16, 000 people were evacuated from the worst affected areas, and an official told CNN two railway systems in the country are out of service. Most flights are canceled throughout the morning out of Taiwan\u2019s Taoyuan International Airport. The storm showered the region with furious winds and rain, CNN affiliate SETTV reported, and violent gusts felled trees and shattered windows in other locations.  Professional stunt rider Dave McKenna, currently in Taiwan, wrote on his Instagram account he could see roofs flying from the seventh floor of his building. \u201dThe streets already look like a bomb has gone off, and this is just the start of it. .. crazy power. I\u2019ve been in some back home in Australia but nothing like this,\u201d he said. Power outages affected more than 500, 000 homes, but electricity was restored to most by Friday night, the emergency operations center said. Thousands of troops have been mobilized across Taiwan and emergency services have been ramped up, according to a Ministry of Defence spokesperson. First this year, Nepartak is Taiwan\u2019s largest super typhoon in about six years and the first for 2016 in the northern hemisphere, after an unusually quiet storm season. Until now, the northwest Pacific had experienced its longest streak on record without a named storm, totaling 200 days since December 2015. On social media, meteorologists and storm chasers have been sharing their awe over the shape and size of super typhoon Nepartak, describing it as a \u201d \u201d storm. Food prices spiked in anticipation, Food prices in Taiwan jumped ahead of the storm, local media reported, while transportation minister Ho Chen Tan promised Taoyuan International Airport would be able to withstand a direct hit from the storm. Although the east coast of Taiwan isn\u2019t heavily populated, the rugged terrain of Taiwan enhances the risk of flooding and landslides during tropical cyclones.  Nepartak originally formed in the open waters of the Pacific on Sunday, south of Guam, and has been steadily moving to the northwest. China braces for even worse flooding, Nepartak is expected to bring further devastating rainfall to China, which is already reeling from its worst flooding since 1998. China Meteorological Administration issued a second orange typhoon alert Friday, the   alert in the system, and recommended all outdoor gatherings be suspended and schools closed.  At least 188 people are dead or missing across 11 provinces since June 30 as a result of heavy flooding, according to the latest numbers from the country\u2019s Ministry of Civil Affairs.  Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui and Shanghai are all expected to be affected by the storm. CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said the majority of rain would fall over southeast China, some distance from the intensely flooded areas to the west of Shanghai. He added that by the time it reached China its speed could have diminished by half to just 120 kph (75 mph). An estimated 29 million people have already been affected by floods, hailstorms and landslides, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said, while China\u2019s Flood Control Department said the country was experiencing its worst flooding since 1998."

Castile was engaged to be married to Diamond Reynolds, who on Wednesday recorded video of Castile dying after being shot by a police officer in Minnesota. His mother, Valerie Castile, said her son was the kind of man who would have followed a police officer\u2019s orders. \u201dHe\u2019s not a gangbanger. He\u2019s not a thug. He\u2019s very respectable,\u201d she said. \u201dAnd I know he didn\u2019t antagonize that officer in any way to make him feel like his life was in danger.\u201d The younger Castile, in his   was a quiet man who worked hard as the cafeteria supervisor at J.

He served as a role model for his young charges, she said. She noted there would be a lot of questions from the kids when they returned to school after summer vacation, and she was glad she had time to think about how she would explain his death. \u201dI am grateful that this is summer, selfishly because I don\u2019t know how to talk to them at all about this, especially my little boys who look like Phil,\u201d she told CNN Friday. \u201dHow do I explain it to them? But come fall we\u2019re going to have to take them in our arms and explain that this wonderful man that they knew day to day is not coming back and why. That is the question, right? How do I tell that to a   old, you know?\u201d  At a rally at the school in St. Paul, Valerie Castile said she thought people who didn\u2019t know her son would have loved him if they had gotten the chance to meet him. His sister, Allysza Castile, said her brother had a \u201dwonderful soul\u201d and a \u201dbeautiful aura.\u201d Allysza Castile told the crowd that he loved the children at the school.  \u201dEvery child here at J.

St. Paul Public Schools issued a statement saying Philando Castile was not only a valued and widely loved employee, but also a product of the school district, having graduated from Central High School in 2001. He began working for the school district the next year and was promoted to supervisor two years ago.  \u201dColleagues describe him as a team player who maintained great relationships with staff and students alike. He had a cheerful disposition and his colleagues enjoyed working with him. He was quick to greet former   with a smile and hug,\u201d the statement said.

Like always, their conversation turned to Philando\u2019s job. \u201dWe ended up talking about retirement, what kind of money he\u2019s putting away for his retirement and things like that,\u201d Clarence Castile said, adding that his nephew had a really good start on saving money. Michael Hollis said he grew up in the same neighborhood as the Castiles. He never knew Philando Castile to get in any trouble.  \u201dHe had a good head on his shoulders and was doing everything the right way,\u201d he said at the rally for his longtime friend Thursday evening. Castile had a concealed carry permit, his fianc\u00e9e and family said, and his mother said when he told her that he wanted to get a gun, she told him, \u201dGo and get your license.\u201d Castile\u2019s mother said Thursday that he and his sister had stopped by her house earlier Wednesday. During the visit, they had discussed the dangers of carrying weapons, even though both of them have concealed carry permits.  \u201dI really don\u2019t even want to carry my gun because I\u2019m afraid that they\u2019ll shoot me first and then ask questions later,\u201d Valerie Castile recalled her daughter saying.  She said she had also had conversations with her son about what to do when he was pulled over by police. Valerie Castile said she focused on one word. \u201dThat was something we always discussed: Comply,\u201d she said. Reynolds says he did comply with everything the officer asked, but he was shot anyway.  "

      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "Peggy Drexler",
      "date": "2016-07-07",
      "content": " (CNN) Recently, longtime Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a lawsuit in New Jersey Superior Court against her former boss, Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, saying Ailes forced her out of the company after she refused, over a number of years, his sexual advances. The New York Times called the lawsuit an \u201dunprecedented public attack\u201d on Ailes, who is one of media\u2019s most powerful figures.  Indeed, Carlson\u2019s move is gutsy. Any time a woman files a claim against a man of sexual misconduct, she must not only prove her allegations are true, but also defend her motives  \u2014   and, too often, her character.  Already, Ailes has responded to the allegations by saying the retaliation was hers, and not his that Carlson\u2019s contract was not renewed due to poor ratings and that she\u2019s acting out of revenge. If that\u2019s the case, she\u2019s certainly not going quietly.  The New York Times reports that the public nature of the suit  \u2014   which included Carlson linking to a copy of the lawsuit on her personal website and launching a Twitter campaign, with the hashtag #StandWithGretchen  \u2014   is unusual, given the fact that many such suits are settled privately.  But perhaps Carlson recognizes that\u2019s part of the problem  \u2014   and part of the reason such incidents continue to occur, not just in the workplace but also on college campuses and in communities around the country. Too many victims stay quiet for too long, if not forever.   Join us on Facebook. . Carlson details her allegations in the suit, in which she accuses Ailes of an ongoing pattern of harassment and describes a corporate culture of sexism she names at least one male   who, she alleges, would condescend and belittle female colleagues. In her suit, she describes a boys\u2019 club atmosphere at Fox News, where for a long time, she alleges, she was ogled and \u201dtreated like a blond female prop.\u201d  She\u2019s discussed other incidents before, as have others    including a \u201dleg cam\u201d and a \u201dno pants rule\u201d    during her tenure as a   on \u201dFox  Friends.\u201d Last year, she wrote about her experience with sexual harassment for the Huffington Post. \u201dI sometimes feel guilty about my trepidation,\u201d she wrote. \u201dPerhaps I could have moved the conversation forward if I had come forth.\u201d And so now she is.  Carlson is both beautiful and brilliant, a former pageant winner  \u2014   she was named Miss America in 1988  \u2014   and trained violinist who graduated from Stanford University and spent a year abroad at Oxford. She is also a journalist with decades of experience working in a   field. She is in a unique position to make a splash, but most certainly not unaware of the challenges ahead.  There will be some who question her motives, or wonder what else went on between Carlson and Ailes that\u2019s yet to have been revealed. There will be some who do so in the crassest of ways. Some will suggest that she\u2019s a woman who used her looks to get ahead when it suited her and, angry that she\u2019s been fired, is using them still.  Perhaps. But it seems unlikely.  Carlson\u2019s attorney (not a disinterested party, of course) told The New York Times that \u201dseveral women had contacted her saying they had similar experiences with Mr. Ailes,\u201d while \u201dother Fox News hosts who did not complain about harassment and rebuff his sexual advances,\u201d were, in turn, given \u201dmedia support and promotion.\u201d The media has so far taken a cautious approach to reporting on the lawsuit (far more cautious, one might argue, than the famously aggressive Fox News itself might have taken were Ailes the head of another network). Some might say that\u2019s because Ailes is powerful, and few are eager to take him on. Or perhaps the media has received the warning of jumping to conclusions in cases like this. But while the facts are still emerging, we have an obligation to hold off judgment until they are all in. But we also have an obligation to believe a woman is not making up sexual harassment. It\u2019s just hard to imagine many women willingly subjecting themselves to the sort of scrutiny Carlson is about to face unless they\u2019ve got a very real reason.  "

      "content": " (CNN) Sen. Ted Cruz, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief rival for the GOP nomination, will speak at the Republican National Convention later this month, the Texas senator told reporters after the two met Thursday in Washington. Cruz told reporters Thursday that the real estate mogul offered his former primary rival a speaking slot during the meeting and he accepted. He added that he and Trump did not discuss an endorsement. \u201dWe had a positive and productive meeting this morning with Donald Trump. Donald asked me to speak at the Republican convention and I told him I\u2019d be happy to do so,\u201d Cruz told reporters. The two men met Thursday with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters where Trump also met with several dozen other Republican senators on Thursday. The meeting marked the first time Cruz and Trump met in person since the Texas senator dropped out of the presidential race more than two months ago. Priebus told Fox News Thursday that Trump and Cruz had \u201da good conversation,\u201d but said that because the meeting was private, he wouldn\u2019t go into specifics.  \u201dI\u2019ll just say they had a good conversation and it was very polite and cordial and normal,\u201d Priebus said. \u201dI know they\u2019re working on details.\u201d A senior Trump campaign official said Trump and Cruz agreed to no longer work against each other and would work together on policy issues where they share common ground. Trump also asked Cruz to help recommend potential judicial nominees, the official said. Trump and Cruz were joined by Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, as well as Cruz\u2019s former campaign chairman Jeff Roe.  The Texas senator has so far refused to endorse Trump, but has not ruled it out. While Cruz resisted criticizing Trump in the initial months of the GOP primary campaign, Cruz would eventually become one of Trump\u2019s fiercest rivals    and the last remaining legitimate challenge to Trump\u2019s campaign to win the Republican presidential nomination. And the final weeks of Cruz\u2019s campaign were dominated by Trump\u2019s personal attacks against the Texas senator and his family as the fight between the two men grew increasingly bitter and personal. In late March, Trump threatened to \u201dspill the beans\u201d on Cruz\u2019s wife after an   super PAC unaffiliated with Cruz\u2019s campaign pushed out a series of digital ads aimed at portraying Trump\u2019s wife in a negative light. And Trump would later also retweet an unflattering picture of the Texans\u2019 wife alongside a glamorous shot of his own wife with the caption \u201dthe images are worth a thousand words.\u201d Trump clashes with congressional critic behind closed doors  And as Indiana\u2019s Republican voters headed to the polls, Trump again turned to the personal, accusing Cruz\u2019s father of being involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Cruz also turned to mudslinging in his campaign against Trump, criticizing the New York billionaire in the final days of the Indiana campaign of being as a \u201dserial philanderer,\u201d \u201dpathological liar\u201d and \u201dnarcissist.\u201d And he opened one of the first fronts in his battle with Trump by hitting Trump as an    candidate with \u201dNew York values.\u201d Returning to the Senate in May after dropping out of the presidential race, Cruz would not express his support for Trump as the GOP nominee    but did not rule it out. \u201dThere are two and a half months until the Republican convention, six months until the general election,\u201d Cruz told reporters in May after returning to Washington. \u201dThere will be plenty of time for voters to make the determination who they\u2019re going to support.\u201d"

It\u2019s up to us to take a stand and demand that they \u2019stop killing us,\u2019\u201d reads a statement from Beyonc\u00e9. The shooting deaths of both men at the hands of police officers has fueled outrage over the treatment of   by law enforcement across the country. Castile, a    public school employee, was shot by a police officer during a traffic stop in Minnesota on Wednesday. Sterling, a    father of five, was shot and killed by officers in Louisiana a day earlier.

      "content": "Washington (CNN) Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker withdrew himself Wednesday from consideration as a possible running mate for Donald Trump. The surprise move comes as sources had told CNN Corker was being \u201dvery seriously\u201d vetted by the Trump campaign. But Corker, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN he is instead open to serving in Trump\u2019s cabinet, perhaps as secretary of state, and will speak at the Republican convention later this month. Corker\u2019s decision was first reported by The Washington Post. \u201dI feel like I\u2019m better suited to other kinds of things and I think there are probably better suited people for this particular job for now,\u201d Corker told CNN on Capitol Hill. Corker declined to say whether he and Trump had discussed particular positions in a Trump administration. \u201dI don\u2019t want to get into that so much,\u201d Corker said. \u201dI think he knows who I am and I think he knows the kind of person who I am.\u201d Corker also suggested a running mate for Trump: his daughter, Ivanka. \u201dHis best running mate, by the way, would be Ivanka,\u201d Corker said. \u201dI know that would not pass muster, but she\u2019s most impressive.\u201d Two sources familiar with the vetting process told CNN earlier Wednesday that Corker was \u201dvery seriously\u201d being vetted and had submitted a lot of information to Trump\u2019s campaign. He was on a very short list, the sources added. But although he had received paperwork from the campaign, he had not turned it all over, a source familiar with the process told CNN. The campaign had yet to ask him for all of the paperwork, and Corker had not had his final interview with Trump regarding the position, the source added. Corker campaigned with Trump in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Tuesday. And he told CNN\u2019s John Berman on Wednesday evening that he felt the Trump campaign was turning a corner in terms of its professionalism. \u201dYou\u2019re going to see a lot of differences moving ahead,\u201d Corker said, voicing his displeasure with the \u201dcaricature\u201d that he said had been sketched of Trump. \u201dThey\u2019re making the adjustments that they need to make to rise to that occasion.\u201d Trump VP search enters home stretch as pick likely next week, Also on Wednesday, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, another potential Trump running mate, downplayed her prospects, telling CNN she has not received documents from the Trump campaign for potential vetting. But she said she was open to speaking at the convention. \u201dWell yes, I would speak,\u201d Ernst told CNN outside her office on Capitol Hill. \u201dI have offered my services and I think it would be a nice opportunity.\u201d Later Wednesday, a Republican adviser confirmed to CNN that Ernst will be speaking at the convention on the topic of national security.  Pressed on whether she has discussed being Trump\u2019s running mate with the candidate himself, Ernst deflected, saying they discussed Iowa\u2019s importance in the upcoming election.  Just two weeks from the Republican National Convention, Trump\u2019s vice presidential search    and speculation about who he\u2019ll pick    is at a fever pitch. Trump tweets fuel VP speculation, Speaking on Fox News Wednesday afternoon, Trump called Corker a \u201dterrific guy\u201d and said he was looking at 10 candidates, including some military generals. \u201dI like the concept of the generals,\u201d Trump said. \u201dThere are two of them under consideration.\u201d Previously, Trump has said he wants someone with political experience to help him pass his legislative agenda through Congress. Trump met in person over the holiday weekend with Ernst and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. And Trump\u2019s recent praise of Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton has recently attracted interest.  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has discussed what an ideal vice presidency would look like to him, will campaign with Trump Wednesday in Ohio. And New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is believed one of the top names on the short list for the number two spot. Christie will travel with Trump to Miami on Friday, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told CNN. But Trump\u2019s campaign has been quiet about who he\u2019ll pick    and when he\u2019ll make an announcement.  \u201dIt\u2019s really going to come down to the personal relationship that he and Mr. Trump could have to find out if they could work well together,\u201d Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201dState of the Union.\u201d Lewandowski, now a CNN political commentator, emphasized the importance of Trump tapping a politician with ties to Washington, who could help advance his legislative agenda in Congress. \u201dHaving someone who has those relationships in Washington is going to be a critical component of his presidency,\u201d Lewandowski said."

Speaking to reporters on a flight to Warsaw, Poland, for a NATO meeting, Carter said the review will \u201dsee if there are any lessons learned.\u201d One aircraft flying air support missions over   during the recent fighting there was called off and diverted to strike at a massive convoy of suspected ISIS militants that had been observed to be trying to leave the southern outskirts of Fallujah, according to a senior U.

      "title": "The question Bangladesh must answer",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "",
      "date": "2016-07-07",
      "content": " (CNN) When I was growing up in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in the 1980s, I always wanted to live in a part of town called Gulshan. In my    mind, it was the center of the universe. My family lived in an older (and not nearly as hip) part of Dhaka city, and they seemed to have no intention of ever moving from my paternal grandparent\u2019s home. As the years went by, even as the rest of the city changed, Gulshan remained    in my mind, at least    the glamorous and unattainable part of town. Framed by its famous deep emerald Gulshan Lake, this was the part of Dhaka that always housed a big chunk of foreign embassies, the best restaurants and cafes, the most luxurious apartments and homes, and countless aid organization offices. That is why it was so unreal    and personally painful    to see Gulshan thrust into the global spotlight in the worst possible way last Friday evening.   hostages, including 18 foreign nationals, were left dead in the upscale Holey Artisan Bakery after a deadly assault by gunmen was brought to an end as police stormed the building following an   siege. It was an attack unlike anything the country had ever seen. Gulshan is not cordoned off like Iraq\u2019s Green Zone, where foreigners and diplomats live and work largely segregated from the local population. Because the aid community in the country is large, especially in the capital, Gulshan is essentially the center of the city for locals, foreigners and diplomats alike. This was almost certainly one of the reasons the attackers chose their target. \u201dPlease pray for the departed and their families, and our staff who lived through the nightmare,\u201d Ali Arsalan, one of the   of Holey, and a longtime family friend, wrote on his personal Facebook page. \u201dWhat happened there is a terrible tragedy and we are shocked to the core. I never thought something created with so much love and a place where there was so much warmth and happiness, would be turned upside down like this. It is difficult to find today the strength to even think of carrying on.\u201d Overnight, it seemed that Bangladesh had gone from being an example of development success and an admirable example of democracy in the Muslim world, to the world\u2019s next Pakistan. But the history of this tiny nation is critical to understanding the dangers to Bangladesh\u2019s secular future    and why it is not yet destined to become another Karachi or Kabul.  Bangladesh has always treasured its secular culture over a religious identity    it never wanted to be East Pakistan. Sadly, it paid for choosing a secular identity over an Islamic one in 1971, during the Liberation War against Pakistan, when as many as 3 million Bangladeshis died, and by some estimates between 200, 000 and 400, 000 Bangladeshi women and girls were raped and tortured, even as a massive refugee crisis spilled into neighboring India. Fast forward to today, and I cannot help but wonder what the men and women who died for a free Bangladesh, our freedom fighters, would have thought about the elements of our society that want to see Bangladesh abandon its secular identity for a religious one.  The reality is that we can no longer deny that something is rotten in Dhaka. For years, we have buried our heads in the sand, looking the other way as bloggers and others were slaughtered in our public spaces. Indeed, the same day as the attack in Gulshan, a Hindu priest was hacked to death as he was gathering flowers at his temple.  Join us on Facebook.  There is no more hiding from the fact that a cancer has infiltrated even the most affluent, young and educated minds of Bangladeshi society. Here in the United States, in the days since the attack, I feel as though I have been watching a   funeral. In many ways I have been    and not just for those who were tragically killed last Friday. I, along with many others, are mourning the death of the Dhaka we grew up in. And I know I am mourning the death of the Gulshan I knew and loved    the place I would have given anything to have lived in as a kid.  Ultimately, we all have blood on our hands. Bangladesh has turned a dark corner, and cannot be the same again. Our innocence has been brutally ripped away from us.  But I still believe in the spirit of the hashtag #DhakaStrong. I know Dhaka is strong. After all, look at everything we have survived, from famines to cyclones to floods to coups to wars. The question, though, is who Bangladesh wants to be now.    years after its war for independence, it is time for Bangladesh to once again choose who it wants to be. In 1971, secularism won. Will it once again?"

      "content": "Mount Ijen, Indonesia (CNN) It has been more than 64 years since Mount Ijen last erupted, but the volcano is still very much alive, and it is being mined by some of the toughest men in the world. They begin work shortly after midnight with a long hike up the volcano. It\u2019s exceptionally dark because the air is thick with volcanic fumes which start to burn our sinuses with an acrid, sour smell halfway up the steep trail. Thick tropical foliage gives way to barren rocks and visibility reduces to barely a meter, even in the direct beam of a flashlight. The headlights worn by miners and tourists making their ascent barely pierce the heavy gloom. At the lip of the crater, some 2, 600 meters above sea level, the density of the fumes dramatically intensifies. Only a serious gas mask    the type normally worn to protect from tear gas in riots    protects our eyes and lungs from the toxic fumes.  WATCH: Ivan Watson\u2019s Facebook Live as he emerges from volcano crater, A tourist from Thailand, overwhelmed by the volcanic gasses, suffers a panic attack in the dark. She coughs and weeps, begging her companion to abandon the volcano. Into the belly of the beast  The subsequent descent into the crater is steep and treacherous, a rocky path slippery with condensation.  It is here, halfway down the crater, that we first spot the volcano\u2019s blue fire flashing through the dense fog and smoke.  Tongues of blue flames ripple up the crater walls like reverse waterfalls. This is the spontaneous combustion of subterranean gasses as they seep out into the night air. Temperatures can exceed 400 degrees Celsius (752 Fahrenheit).   The air may be poisonous, but these cobalt fireworks are magical. According to Peter Kelly, a gas geochemist with the USGS, they are also quite rare.  \u201dIjen is remarkable in that it has sustained the special conditions that lead to the occurrence of the blue flames for a long time,\u201d Kelly told CNN. At the bottom of the crater the scene grows even more surreal. Here, a dozen Indonesian men work in the dark, using long metal poles to break off chunks of yellow crust from the crater floor. They are harvesting sulfur. This hard, chalky mineral builds up around vents that belch out clouds of grey and yellow smoke from inside the volcano. When dawn breaks, it reveals a lake just a stone\u2019s throw away from where the miners are working.  The crater lake is a milky blue, with fumes billowing across its surface.  The water in the lake is warm to the touch and 200 meters deep. The lake is also heavily acidic, the result of volcanic gases like sulfur dioxide dissolving into the water. Merely dipping a few fingers into the water leaves the fingers burning because of small, unseen cuts. Periodically, the wind shifts the direction of the smoke, which envelopes the miners in hot clouds of volcanic gas.  At those moments, the men cough and retch, struggling with the fumes. \u201dNo mask!\u201d says a miner with a choking laugh. He points at the gas masks we are wearing.  Like most of the other miners here, this man is equipped with little more than a rag stuffed in his mouth that he sucks on to help cope with the poisonous gas. He goes by a single name, Mistari, as is often the case on the large Indonesian island of Java. Mistari says he has spent years mining the volcano. Mistari and the other miners break off chunks of sulfur ore and load them into pairs of baskets attached at opposite ends of a long bar of wood.  Each man focuses intently on perfectly balancing the heavy load between the two baskets. This is of vital importance, because the miners are about to haul the baskets up the treacherous trail that leads to the top of the crater\u2019s lip. It is a   journey.  \u2019I don\u2019t want my son to work like this\u2019 As he begins the steep hike, Mistari wheezes under the weight of the baskets. Over the years, this burden has left a deep, permanent groove on his shoulder. He is carrying a man\u2019s weight in sulfur on his shoulders, roughly 80 kilograms of ore.  \u201dThe smoke burns my eyes but it\u2019s not poison,\u201d he insists.   \u201dI\u2019ve gotten used to this work, so it doesn\u2019t really hurt me.\u201d Mistari is 42 years old. It takes him about a half hour to complete the hike to the top of the volcano. It is the first of two such trips he typically makes a day. \u201dI never get back pain,\u201d he explains. \u201dJust my knees hurt a bit.\u201d The company pays him the equivalent of around 8 U. S. cents per kilo of sulfur.  Mistari says on average, he earns the equivalent of $12 a day. At the top of the crater, some of the miners transfer their sulfur to small trolleys which they then haul down the mountain. One miner, named Osen, doesn\u2019t have that luxury.  \u201dI can\u2019t afford a trolley so I have to carry my sulfur down,\u201d he tells me.  Osen stops at a weigh station and hangs his baskets on a crude scale. The man is hauling 95 kilograms of sulfur a distance of roughly four kilometers. \u201dIt\u2019s hot here in my back,\u201d he says, pointing at the spot on his shoulder where he carries the heavy load. The miners insist they make good money at what may be one of the world\u2019s most physically demanding jobs. Most of them would otherwise work as farmers, earning much less. Thermal camera captures volcanic eruption, That said, Mistari says he does not want his    son to follow in his father\u2019s painful footsteps. \u201dNo, no, I don\u2019t want my son to work like this,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u2019I\u2019ve never heard of anything like this\u2019 An executive with the sulfur mining company PT Candi Ngrimbi says with the help of miners like Mistari, it produces some 13 tons of raw sulfur a day from the Ijen volcano. \u201dWe give the miners paper masks, but they rarely wear them,\u201d Budio Prawito, an executive in the company\u2019s finance department, tells CNN. \u201dThey prefer to use towels or clothes.\u201d The sulfur mining company says it provides health insurance to 107 registered,   miners. Job qualifications appear simple. \u201dIt\u2019s easy,\u201d Prawito says. \u201dWe see how fit and strong they are to carry sulfur. Usually we accept young, healthy people.\u201d Terry Gordon, a professor of environmental medicine at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine, says no one has studied the impact of long term exposure to such high levels of volcanic gases, including sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. The miners \u201dare sort of the test subjects,\u201d he says.   exposure to sulfur dioxide is linked to airway constriction and asthma symptoms.  U. S. regulators recommend limiting regular workplace exposure to two parts per million    USGS scientists have found levels more than 30 times that near to the site where the Ijen miners work. Gordon believes the miners have likely adapted in a way that lessens their discomfort, but the conditions could still cause harm.   \u201dThat there are humans working in those conditions, I think it\u2019s unparalleled. I\u2019ve never heard of anything like this,\u201d Gordon says.  \u201dThat these guys can take these toxic gases day after day, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d Factory in the jungle, In the end, the sulfur is trucked down to a crude factory in the middle of the tropical jungle.   ovens heat giant cauldrons where workers melt chunks of sulfur ore down to a liquid.  A stream of molten sulfur flows down a wooden sluice and through filters that help purify it. A factory worker dumps big vats of liquid sulfur onto a wide floor. There it quickly solidifies into a bright yellow crust which is broken into pieces and loaded into sacks. The volcanic sulfur is primarily used to purify sugar at nearby sugar factories. The mineral is also used to make soap, skin treatments and explosives. Workers at the sulfur factory say they are paid half of what the miners earn wheezing and grunting in the crater. \u201dWorking here is much better,\u201d explains Ahmad Supanpi, as he shovels wood into the ovens. Among the factory workers is    Sapii, who retired from mining the volcano. \u201dI don\u2019t have the strength to work on the mountain any more,\u201d he says. Although it has been four years since he left the volcano, his shoulders are still grooved and   from years of hauling sulfur up the crater. He insists his time in the volcano have not left him with any permanent health problems aside from \u201dan ordinary cough.\u201d Dying for gold: South African miners face fatal disease, With that, he goes back to scooping the volcano\u2019s yellow harvest off the factory floor."

      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "",
      "date": "2016-07-07",
      "content": " (CNN) Republicans have long insisted that former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus\u2019 mishandling of classified information was far less egregious misconduct than Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email use while leading the State Department. The talking point has gained steam this week after FBI Director James Comey recommended that the Justice Department bring no charges against Clinton, with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump even suggesting a nefarious motive behind the decision. On Thursday, Comey was given an opportunity to rebut some of those charges during a hearing on Capitol Hill before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. \u201dThe Petraeus case, to my mind, illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the Department of Justice is willing to prosecute,\u201d Comey told the committee.  Petraeus, the   general who oversaw military operations in both Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned as CIA director in 2012 after his extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, became public.  The FBI and Justice Department later recommended felony charges against him for sharing classified information with Broadwell. He ultimately avoided jail time after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor last year, resulting in two years probation and a $100, 000 fine. At the time, members of Congress from both sides of the aisle rallied to Petraeus\u2019 defense and criticized the Justice Department for pursuing the case.  Republicans have argued that Petraeus\u2019 malfeasance was petty, especially relative to Clinton\u2019s use of a private email servers.  Trump has made that point repeatedly. In April, he predicted that Clinton would not be indicted. \u201dI know for a fact that what Gen. Petraeus and others have done was much less,\u201d Trump said at the time, adding that Democrats were protecting Clinton from legal fallout. Trump invoked a nearly identical line Tuesday, after Comey announced his recommendation to bring no charges against Clinton. \u201dThe system is rigged,\u201d the GOP nominee said on Twitter. At the hearing on Thursday, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, the committee\u2019s ranking member, invited Comey to counter those claims. Comey pointed out that Petraeus not only shared the classified information, but also hid the documents in his attic and then lied to investigators. \u201dSo you have obstruction of justice, you have intentional misconduct and a vast quantity of information,\u201d Comey said. \u201dHe admitted he knew that was the wrong thing to do. That is a perfect illustration of the kind of cases that get prosecuted.\u201d He added: \u201dIn my mind, it illustrates importantly the distinction to this case.\u201d Comey was called to Capitol Hill by Republicans who were left frustrated over his decision to recommend no charges against Clinton.  On Tuesday, Comey said Clinton was \u201dextremely careless\u201d in her handling of classified information, but that \u201dno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring a case against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said at the hearing on Thursday that he was \u201dmystified and confused\u201d by the conclusions Comey reached. \u201dIt seems to a lot of us that the Average Joe, the average American, that if they had done what you laid out in your statement, that they would be in handcuffs and they might be on their way to jail,\u201d Chaffetz told Comey.

Lawyers for the    entertainer asked Judge Steven O\u2019Neill to throw out the charges against Cosby.

Cosby\u2019s lawyers, through spokesman Andrew Wyatt, said in a statement: \u201dOnce again the prosecution had the opportunity and the obligation to place Mr. Cosby\u2019s accuser under oath so that we can search for the truth but they refused. In this courthouse and in this state, we have always protected the liberty of our citizens by requiring accusations like these to be tested by an examination under oath but not today. Today a man who has meant so much to so many a man who has given so much to so many has had his constitutional rights trampled on. We truly believe that our Supreme Court will right this wrong and reverse this decision so that we can finish the mission of proving Mr. Cosby\u2019s innocence.\u201d After the hearing, the chief prosecutor criticized defense lawyers. \u201dThe defense operated under a mistaken belief that they had a right to confront the victim at this stage,\u201d Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said outside court. \u201dThey do not. If he wants to confront witnesses let\u2019s get this case to trial.\u201d Though more than 50 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct and some have filed lawsuits, the Constand case is the only criminal prosecution, because the statute of limitations has passed for the other cases. Constand filed a lawsuit against Cosby and the two sides reached a civil settlement in 2006. The criminal case was reopened as new evidence came to light, including a number of other accusers coming forward and the release of some of Cosby\u2019s remarks during a 2005 deposition that were recently unsealed. Steele, the newly elected district attorney, turned the Cosby case into an election issue. He promptly reopened it after taking office. Cosby was charged with three felonies and arraigned in December, then released on $1 million bond. Cosby sued Constand in February, claiming she violated terms of the 2006 settlement."

      "content": "Washington (CNN) Voters are more tuned into the race for president than usual, but this year\u2019s increased interest may stem more from frustration than hope.  A new survey from the Pew Research Center finds American voters rate their choice of candidates as the least satisfying since 1992. At the same time, almost   say the outcome of the election matters to the nation\u2019s ability to make progress on important issues, and 8 in 10 say they\u2019ve given quite a lot of thought to the election. Only about 4 in 10 Democrats and Republicans alike said they were satisfied with this year\u2019s presidential candidates. That marks the first time Democratic satisfaction has dipped below 50% since Bill Clinton\u2019s first run for the White House in 1992, and 4 points below the previous GOP low reached in 1996 when Bob Dole challenged Clinton. And more so than in any election year back to 2000, Americans say it\u2019s difficult to choose between the two major party candidates because neither one would make a good president. Overall, 41% said they agreed with that statement, up from the previous high of 36% in 2000. Republicans (46% agree) were more apt to say so than Democrats (33% agree). Read the results, But Americans\u2019 interest in the 2016 campaign is reaching new highs.  A stunning 85% say they\u2019ve been following news about presidential candidates very or fairly closely, above the levels saying the same at this point in previous election years. And the 80% who say they\u2019ve given \u201dquite a lot\u201d of thought to the election stands well above the 67% who said so at this stage in 2012, the 72% who had paid that much attention as of June 2008, 58% in June 2004, 46% in June 2000, 50% in 1996 or 63% in 1992.  Both Democrats and Republicans report giving a lot of thought to the election at higher rates than in previous years, but Democrats\u2019 attentiveness to news about the campaign is about on par with 2008. The poll, conducted from June 15 to 26, found Hillary Clinton holding a   edge over Donald Trump, whether Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was included in the question or not. In a   race, Clinton tops Trump 51% to 42%. In the   matchup, Clinton and Trump drop 6 points each, while Johnson lands at 11% support, his highest standing since a Fox News poll in early June found 12% backing the Libertarian candidate. Johnson\u2019s backing spikes among younger voters 22% of registered voters under age 30 say they would back him. Factoring the Pew results into CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls, Clinton averages 47% support over the five most recent publicly released nationwide telephone polls, while Trump stands at 40%. Rating the two candidates across a wide range of issues, the Pew survey finds Clinton holding an edge on handling race relations, abortion, foreign policy, health care, selecting Supreme Court justices and dealing with immigration. Majorities say they trust Clinton on each of those issues. Clinton has a narrower edge on managing the federal government. Clinton and Trump run more closely on handling trade or gun policy, while Trump holds a narrow advantage on improving economic conditions and defending future terrorist attacks. He tops Clinton by 20 points on reducing the influence of special interests. Beyond the candidates themselves, voters rate the campaign so far as broadly too negative: 68% say so, compared with 53% in 2012 and roughly half in 2008 or 2004. Further, almost   say the campaign isn\u2019t focused on important policy debates. They are also more apt than in previous years to call it interesting 77% say so now, up from a previous high of 62% in 2008. Only 2016 and 2008 were rated more interesting than dull in Pew polls dating back to 1996. The Pew Research Center survey was conducted by telephone June 15 through 26 among a random national sample of 2, 245 adults, including 1, 655 registered voters. Results for the sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2. 7 percentage points."

      "title": "Obama heads to NATO summit at \u2019inflection point\u2019",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "Kevin Liptak",
      "date": "2016-07-07",
      "content": " (CNN) President Barack Obama arrived in Poland Thursday for a   NATO summit, marking what\u2019s likely to be his final presidential trip to Europe as the continent faces a moment of historic uncertainty. The United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit the European Union, which Obama campaigned ardently against, has thrown the bloc into chaos. The undercurrents that pushed \u201dBrexit\u201d through, like opposition to immigration and trade deals, could wind up blemishing Obama\u2019s own legacy. And Russian aggression also is a growing concern for the alliance, with Defense Secretary Ash Carter addressing the issue and the need for increased NATO deterrence when he spoke to reporters on his flight to Poland Thursday.  With a   path toward a final Brexit split, leaders like outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel    the two heads of state to whom Obama is closest    will arrive at this week\u2019s summit eager to hear from the President directly. Aides say Obama will also look to gain a better sense of how and when the British exit will proceed.   In addition, a spate of global terror attacks in the final week of Ramadan, including in the capital of NATO member Turkey, will provide the alliance with new challenges. Doug Lute, the U. S. permanent representative to NATO, described the summit as coming at an \u201dinflection point\u201d for the alliance that hasn\u2019t been seen since in two decades.  He cited Russian aggression, the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and the rise of ISIS as fueling the sense the summit is occurring at a critical moment.  \u201dAll these factors in multiple directions combine to really mark this as different in NATO\u2019s long history,\u201d he said. \u201dBy my count, there hasn\u2019t been another inflection point like this for the Alliance since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in \u201989 to \u201991. So this is a bit of a historic point, and it\u2019s a great point for the summit, especially as the President wraps up his tenure as the leader of the alliance.\u201d Obama was set to meet with top European leaders, including the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, upon arriving in Poland. For Obama, who has worked during his two terms to \u201dpivot\u201d foreign policy away from Europe and toward the Asia Pacific, the meeting represents how slow progress can be in shifting from the traditional areas of focus for the United States. NATO\u2019s standoff with Russian President Vladimir Putin over aggression in Ukraine has revived Cold   suspicions, disappointing a White House intent on fostering global cooperation. Obama spoke with Putin on Wednesday ahead of his departure for the summit. The Russian leader has grown increasingly hostile toward NATO as the alliance has bolstered its troop levels in Eastern Europe, saying in May he would respond \u201dappropriately.\u201d Furthermore, Obama\u2019s announcement Wednesday that he would leave more U. S. troops in Afghanistan when he departs office than originally planned underscored the difficulty he\u2019s faced in moving past the global conflicts of his predecessors. An administration official said Obama made the Afghanistan announcement ahead of the NATO summit to provide \u201dclarity about our intentions\u201d heading into the meeting. NATO, with U. S. backing, has led the mission to train Afghan security forces since the end of combat there in 2014. In Warsaw, Obama will press fellow leaders to increase financial contributions for the Afghanistan mission, and to maintain pressure on Putin as Russian provocations persist in Eastern Europe. During past visits to Europe, including during 2014\u2019s NATO summit in Wales, Obama\u2019s goal had been to reassure allies the United States was committed to upholding its treaty obligations in protecting them against border incursions. Gen. Philip Breedlove, who retired earlier this year as the head of U. S. European Command and as NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, said he expected the focus of the summit to shift from reassurance toward actually deterring Russian aggression through the deployment of NATO forces in Eastern Europe. \u201dDeterrence . .. a step on the journey, and deterrence will be enhanced as that journey goes along,\u201d Breedlove said during a talk at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in late June. \u201dIt could be one of the biggest deliverables in Warsaw.\u201d Carter told reporters Thursday that NATO is moving toward greater deterrence, something it hasn\u2019t had to do in a quarter century. He added that NATO still works with Russia where it can find common ground.  In June, NATO announced it was deploying four multinational battalions to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland amid   tensions with Moscow. Obama also hopes to pressure European leaders to maintain sanctions on Russian as punishment for the Ukraine incursion, though economic uncertainty in Europe could make that argument harder, given closer business ties to Russia in Europe than in the U. S. U. S. officials have downplayed the security risks that Britain\u2019s decision to exit the EU could cause. But because the precise terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the union are still being determined, it\u2019s not yet clear how the vote will affect security ties within the continent or with the United States. Obama insisted in Canada at the end of last month that Britain and Europe proceed carefully    even as leaders like Merkel are pushing for a faster resolution in the interest of providing greater certainty. \u201dEverybody should catch their breath, come up with a plan and a process that is orderly, that\u2019s transparent, that people understand, and then proceed understanding that both sides have a stake in getting this right,\u201d Obama said. In Warsaw, Obama isn\u2019t likely to alleviate much of the   anxiety that roiled markets and has prompted calls for independence votes from Northern Ireland to Catalonia. But he will push leaders to develop closer cooperation between NATO and the EU, which have historically operated separately, despite overlapping memberships. \u201dIf anything, it just strengthens the need for enhanced   cooperation,\u201d said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the Brexit vote. \u201dBoth the European Union and NATO face a new security environment with new threats: hybrid, terrorism, instability,\u201d he added. \u201dNeither the European Union nor NATO possesses all the tools to respond. So, therefore, we have to work together.\u201d"

      "date": "2016-07-07",
      "content": " (CNN) A star, caught in the grips of a supermassive black hole.  The immense gravity slowly strips the stellar material from its parent, forming a disc of gas around the black hole as it converts gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation, producing a bright source of light visible on multiple wavelengths.  Then, even more dramatically, a narrow beam of particles shoots out of the black hole at almost the speed of light.  This galactic phenomenon    known as relativistic jets    was first discovered almost five years ago.  Further clues as to how a black hole feeding on a star produced such outbursts were revealed in March, and now researchers have used an   radio telescope network to make   observations of the phenomenon.  Red flashes reveal black hole feeding on star, \u2019Sharpest measurements ever made\u2019 An international team of astronomers, led by Jun Yang at Sweden\u2019s Chalmers University of Technology, used the European VLBI Network (EVN) to study the event known as Swift J1644+57.  First discovered in 2011, Swift J1644+57 is a supermassive black hole slowly swallowing a star. Or rather, was, the galaxy in which the incredible astronomical event is taking place is so far away its light takes 3. 9 billion years to reach Earth.  As the ancient star was sucked into the black hole, Yang says it produced jets of light and particles equivalent to the size \u201dof a 2 euro coin on the Moon as seen from Earth.\u201d  \u201dThese are some of the sharpest measurements ever made by radio telescopes,\u201d he said in a statement.  Such accuracy was made possible by new technology that uses a network of huge telescopes across our planet, knitting together their observations into an   scope that is far more powerful than the sum of its parts.  We may soon finally know what a black hole actually looks like, Next generation telescopes, The team says its findings are likely only the beginning, giving us ever greater insights into one of space\u2019s least understood phenomena.  Earlier this year, gravitational waves created by the merging of two black holes were detected, proving a key part of Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, just over 100 years after it was first published.  \u201dObservations with the next generation of radio telescopes will tell us more about what actually happens when a star is eaten by a black hole    and how powerful jets form and evolve right next to black holes,\u201d Stefanie Komossa, astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, said in a statement.  Yang agrees. \u201dIn the future, new, giant telescopes like FAST (Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) and SKA (Square Kilometer Array) will allow us to make even more detailed observations of these extreme and exciting events.\u201d "

We\u2019re going to the final!\u201d  The chants start up prematurely    as the second goal hits the back of the net    but ultimately prove prescient.  Antoine Griezmann    one of the stars of the tournament after a stellar year in Spain    booked the host\u2019s place in the final of Euro 2016 with two   goals here, sending Marseillaise fans into a joyful frenzy as the hosts set their eyes on the Stade de France showpiece against Portugal on Sunday. READ MORE: France stuns Germany to reach final, Cars frantically honk as that second goal goes in    unaware of the scorer but ecstatic that France has struck again.  As a chorus of \u201dAllez les Bleus!\u201d (\u201dGo on the Blues! \u201d) is struck up, the horns strike up again, honking in time. It\u2019s repeated when France goalkeeper Hugo Loris saves a shot from a crucial scuffle as the match comes to an exhilarating climax.   mentality, Marseille is a football city, in the way that Liverpool, Glasgow and Hamburg are football cities. There is a gritty sharpness here, a   mentality    and humor    that goes well with their football. The city has been the birthplace some of France\u2019s greatest footballing heroes, notably Eric Cantona and Zinedine Zidane, and it\u2019s a legacy that its citizens revel in. The atmosphere in the city on Thursday, but also at the other games Marseille has hosted, was electric. \u201dIt can be hot. It\u2019s France and it\u2019s Marseille,\u201d says Eric Tessier, originally from Brittany in northwest France but a longtime resident of North Carolina.  And as the game swung back and forth, he hedged his bets. \u201dThe German (team) are a Niagara Falls to cross.\u201d But the tightrope has been walked. Great things expected? As France continues to impress at Euro 2016, anticipation is as high as it\u2019s been in the country since, arguably, the last major tournament held here    the 1998 World Cup. That team has gone down in history, and the people of Marseille are hopeful that this year\u2019s vintage will go on to challenge for even greater things  \u2014   although not everyone was convinced at the beginning of the tournament. \u201dIt\u2019s special because it\u2019s in Marseille,\u201d says Kevin Boucaron, a Marseillaise fan watching the game from the pavement outside L\u2019Osteria du Prado, a small bar that has spilled out onto the street for the occasion, on the Avenue du Prado, one of the city\u2019s main arteries. \u201dIt\u2019s special because it was unexpected.\u201d So, they sing. As the fans inside the stadium sing that rousing anthem, outside the air reverberates.  Of course, only this town could inspire one of the world\u2019s most stirring national anthems    \u201dLa Marseillaise.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful song, and the Germans seem visibly twitchy standing in the middle of the Stade Velodrome, a stadium so often described as Marseille\u2019s 12th man. It seems to work.  Ahead of the final, tickets were changing hands for hundreds, even thousands of Euros. The Stade Velodrome, Olympique Marseille\u2019s home, holds close to 70, 000 but there are thousands more who pack the fan zones and line the streets, craning to get a look at   TVs outside bars. A French mirror? It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but Les Bleus\u2019 diverse team has long been hailed as a true mirror of multicultural France, and scanning along the players as they belt out \u201dLa Marseillaise\u201d the diversity is immediately apparent. The clich\u00e9 was most commonly trotted out almost 20 years ago, when the   1998 team, led by Zidane    of Algerian descent    and Marcel Desailly, originally from Ghana, swept all before them, upsetting a   Brazil side in the final. It\u2019s not all roses, though    and ahead of the tournament Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema accused coach Didier Deschamps of omitting him to appease \u201da racist part of France.\u201d France\u2019s junior minister for sports, Thierry Braillard tweeted that Benzema\u2019s statements to Marca were \u201dunjustified and unacceptable. Total support to FFF and Didier Deschamps.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s just something that people like to say to destabilize the team,\u201d says Boucaron, the fan watching from the street. Bete noir? Grudges in European football are nothing new, and every team has a \u201dbete noir\u201d    but Germany collects them like it was collecting football stickers for its Euro 2016 album. READ: U. S. aiming for World Cup semis, There\u2019s the one with the Dutch    who still sing about the bicycles the Nazi invaders stole    as well as of course the English, who use their 1966 World Cup victory (as well as the tired refrain, \u201dtwo World Wars\u201d) as a cudgel with which to beat their old sporting enemy.   With France, there were historical wrongs to right    most notably the World Cup in 1982, a scar on the two countries\u2019 sporting relations, when, on a muggy night in Seville, German keeper Toni Schumacher escaped sanction for a brutal challenge on French player Patrick Battiston and set up one of the most   penalty shootouts in the game\u2019s history before Germany triumphed. Read: Full Euro 2016 coverage,   captain Michel Platini said of that night: \u201dThat was my most beautiful game. What happened in those two hours encapsulated all the sentiments of life itself.  \u201dNo film or play could ever recapture so many contradictions and emotions. It was complete. So strong. It was fabulous.\u201d  And now those demons have been laid to rest.  As the final whistle blew, the streets erupted and the party moved from the stadium to the roundabout in front of it    tricolors, beer and optimism moving this French team on to the next stage, and, these fans hope and pray, victory once again in Paris against Portugal on Sunday."

Then last month, the congressional ethics committee voted to strip him of his congressional seat.

      "content": "Washington (CNN) Newt Gingrich on Thursday defended Donald Trump\u2019s controversial tweet about Hillary Clinton featuring the Star of David over a field of money, telling CNN there was nothing   about the image and that the recent uproar was an \u201dabsurd\u201d and \u201ddemagogic\u201d attack orchestrated by the media. The former House speaker, who is one of the top candidates to be Trump\u2019s vice presidential nominee, said in a phone interview that he was \u201dvery angry\u201d about what he considered to be \u201dthe media\u2019s deliberate distortion.\u201d He defended the Republican presumptive nominee, in part by pointing to the Jewish members of Trump\u2019s family.  \u201dI think it is so profoundly dishonest that it sickens me and makes me very angry,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201dThe media\u2019s deliberate distortion. It\u2019s absurdity. He has got a    who\u2019s an Orthodox Jew, his daughter has converted to Judaism, grandchildren who are Jewish. And he gave a speech at AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) that was pretty definitive. And in the middle of this, you get this kind of smear?\u201d Gingrich also said Trump will continue to attack media outlets    including CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post    in the way that he did at a rally Wednesday in Ohio. \u201dHe\u2019s not going to back off,\u201d he said. \u201dA substantial part of the campaign is going to be    if you think the news media is honest and fair and totally neutral, then you ought to vote for Hillary. But if you think the news media is biased, then join me,\u201d Gingrich added. The controversy over Trumps\u2019s tweet began Saturday when Trump tweeted a graphic that labeled Clinton the \u201dmost corrupt candidate ever.\u201d The image featured a   star and a pile of cash    which many critics said had clear   connotations. It was later altered to replace the star with a circle.  It was subsequently revealed that the original image had previously been posted on an   white supremacist message board.  Gingrich, an outspoken supporter of Israel, echoed Trump\u2019s newest defense of the tweet: that a   star is featured on a book about the popular Disney movie \u201dFrozen.\u201d \u201dJust think about it for a second    you\u2019re doing a tweet about how somebody who is a crook so you put in cash. That doesn\u2019t imply that she is Jewish. It implies she\u2019s a crook,\u201d he said. \u201dWe found exactly the same star was being used in a book about \u2019Frozen\u2019 by Disney. Does anybody want to argue that Frozen is  ?\u201d Gingrich\u2019s defense puts him squarely at odds with other Republicans, including the current House Speaker, Paul Ryan.  The Wisconsin lawmaker slammed the tweet earlier this week and warned that   images \u201dhave no place in a presidential campaign.\u201d \u201dI really believe he has to clean up the way his (social) media works,\u201d Ryan said on the Charlie Sykes radio program. \u201dThey\u2019ve got to clean this thing up.\u201d Under fire for the tweet, Trump has doubled down, once again raising concerns about whether the candidate is capable of practicing message discipline. Republicans fear that the unfiltered rhetoric that helped Trump win the GOP primary will alienate important demographic groups during the general election, including independents and women.  At a rally in Cincinnati, Trump said he \u201dshouldn\u2019t have\u201d removed the original tweet and accused the media of having \u201dracist tendencies.\u201d \u201dActually they\u2019re racially profiling. They\u2019re racially profiling. Not us. Why do they bring this up?\u201d Trump said. \u201dThese people are sick.\u201d Gingrich, who campaigned with Trump in Cincinnati, told CNN on Thursday that the issue of the vice presidential selection process did not come up when the two spoke. \u201dI think he\u2019s checking out the chemistry and the feel with a number of people,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201dWe like each other, we have a lot of fun and we\u2019re both willing to take on the traditional system so we\u2019re happily doing that.\u201d He added that he expects to speak at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland later this month.

      "content": " (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired the man leading the federal investigation into his campaign\u2019s alleged ties to Russia.  James Comey was dismissed from his post as FBI director, the White House said, on the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. They cited Comey\u2019s handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, a controversy that many believe helped Trump defeat the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election.   At a glance, Comey, a career prosecutor, is an unlikely candidate to take center stage in the most charged political drama of this generation, but history shows he has a tendency to turn up in the headlines. Here are seven things to know about James Comey: He delivered an unprecedented \u201dOctober Surprise\u201d last year, Comey announced on October 28, 2016    less than two weeks before the presidential election    that the bureau would investigate more emails potentially related to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server. The news sent a jolt through the political world, setting off alarm and anger among Democrats who worried the news would swing the election to Trump. Clinton has said she believes Comey\u2019s decision did just that, saying last week, \u201dIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president.\u201d Still, when Comey\u2019s dismissal was made public late Tuesday, former Clinton staffers, many of whom had been harshly critical of Comey, suggested on Twitter that Trump\u2019s decision was politically motivated. The story, though, goes back further than that. In July 2016, Comey invited scorn from Republicans    and quiet frustration from Democrats    when he revealed his office\u2019s decision not to recommend charges against Clinton, though not before publicly excoriating the candidate for her actions.  He opposed Bush White House officials in a dramatic standoff  Comey, who was appointed to a   term that would have carried into the next administration, came into national prominence in 2007 when, during testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he told the story of a tense standoff over a federal domestic surveillance program with top officials from the administration of President George W. Bush. (Comey had been tapped as a deputy US attorney general under Bush in 2003.) The incident took place in the evening of March 10, 2004, according to Comey\u2019s account, with   General John Ashcroft ill and incapacitated in a hospital intensive care unit. Top White House lawyer Alberto Gonzales (who would later become US attorney general) and Bush Chief of Staff Andrew Card had raced to Ashcroft\u2019s side in an effort to have him sign off on an extension to the wiretapping program, which Justice Department attorneys had deemed illegal. The weakened Ashcroft managed to make clear his refusal and Gonzales and Card left the room    with Comey, then Ashcroft\u2019s top deputy, watching on    without a word. He prosecuted Martha Stewart  When lifestyle guru Martha Stewart was indicted in 2003 on a series of charges connected to a dodgy 2000 stock deal, it was Comey who brought the charges. \u2019\u2019This criminal case is about lying    lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC, lying to investors,\u201d Comey, then a US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a press conference. \u2019\u2019Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not for who she is, but because of what she did. \u2019\u2019 Stewart was convicted on all counts in 2004 and sentenced to five months in prison. She served her time and was released in March 2005. He\u2019d investigated the Clintons previously, In fact, the email server probe marked the third time Comey has investigated Bill or Hillary Clinton.  Their first   came in the   when Comey joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as a deputy special counsel. There he dug into allegations that the Clintons took part in a fraud connected to a Arkansas real estate venture gone bust. No charges were ever brought against either Clinton, but the scandal would eventually lead to independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s probe that would result in the Lewinsky scandal. In 2002, Comey, then a federal prosecutor, took over an investigation into President Bill Clinton\u2019s 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich, who had been indicted on a laundry list of charges before fleeing the country. The decision set off a political firestorm focused on accusations that Rich\u2019s   Denise made donations to the Democratic Party, the Clinton Library and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate campaign as part of a plan to get Rich off the hook. Comey ultimately decided not to pursue the case.  The kicker: Comey himself had overseen Rich\u2019s prosecution between 1987 and 1993. He was locked up and held at gunpoint by a   serial criminal as a teen  Comey\u2019s first brush with the law was a traumatizing one.  In October 1977, he and his younger brother were held captive in their home by the   \u201dRamsey Rapist.\u201d The armed man, who cops were hunting following a series of home invasions, had recently assaulted two babysitters in the area.  According to an account in the Bergen Record, the Comey brothers were held at gunpoint and locked in a bathroom inside their family\u2019s Allendale, New Jersey, house. They escaped through a window but were confronted outside by the suspect before bolting back in and contacting police.  He was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate in 2013, Comey became the seventh FBI director when he was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 2013, by a   count, with Sen. Rand Paul the lone holdout. The Kentucky Republican had threatened to block Comey\u2019s nomination, but relented and allowed a vote after being further briefed on FBI drone surveillance policy. Comey succeeded Robert Mueller III, who had held the job for the previous 12 years. He was a registered Republican for many years, In testimony on Capitol Hill, Comey insisted that his FBI is \u201dresolutely apolitical.\u201d Comey himself, however, does have a partisan past    as a Republican.  \u201dI have been a registered Republican for most of my adult life,\u201d he said before adding that he is \u201dnot registered any longer.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: This story, first published in July, has been updated after FBI Director James Comey was fired by President Trump on Tuesday evening."

      "title": "GOP gun bill waits in limbo ",
      "publication": "CNN",
      "author": "Deirdre Walsh",

      "content": " (CNN) A   gun bill pushed by House Republicans leaders remains in limbo because a key bloc of conservatives opposes it and GOP leaders can\u2019t muster the votes to pass it.   Democrats pounced on the issue Thursday, tying up the House floor for hours with another push for votes on measures to expand background checks and prevent those on the terror watch list from buying guns.  House Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged that he had work to do with his own members to get consensus on his legislation, which is part of   package of measures he and other leaders drafted and planned to vote on this week.   \u201dWe\u2019re not going to rush it,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said at a news conference. \u201dWe\u2019re going to get it right. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on with our members.\u201d Ryan facing GOP resistance on gun tactics, The speaker also vowed Democrats would face sanctions for the     they launched last month on the House floor that delayed legislative business and forced GOP leaders to cut their voting schedule short.   \u201dMake my day. Make my day.\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi replied, daring Republicans to call more attention to the protest, with a comment reminiscent of Clint Eastwood\u2019s famous \u201dDirty Harry\u201d character. Republicans planned a vote this week on legislation that would ban gun sales to those on a government watch list    a measure inserted into a broader Homeland Security bill. But several conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus maintain that the provision in the bill threatens individuals\u2019 Second Amendment right to bear arms.  Other Republicans have expressed frustration that scheduling a vote on a gun bill plays into Democrats\u2019 narrative that new laws are the way to address the recent spate of attacks like the one at an Orlando gay nightclub inspired by the terror group ISIS. Pelosi argued the delay on moving the GOP bill \u201dshows that House Republicans are completely untethered from the reality of gun violence in our country.\u201d Many House Republicans are growing impatient that the Speaker and other leaders haven\u2019t dealt out punishment to Democrats for the protest, which caught them off guard and pushed off votes on other priorities before the Fourth of July holiday break. The effort was led by civil rights icon, Rep. John Lewis, of Georgia, and during the lengthy   administrative staff did little to shut it down for fear of giving the effort an even larger public profile.  RELATED: The changing politics of gun control, The speaker told reporters Thursday that episode turned the House floor into \u201da partisan war zone.\u201d Ryan and other top GOP leaders met with the House Sergeant at Arms, Parliamentarian and Rules Committee staff to review what happened during on the lengthy sit in and discuss possible penalties.  Most House Democrats participated in the unprecedented effort and broke longstanding rules about protesting in groups, political activity and speaking out of order when the chair gavels it\u2019s time to move onto other business.  Because the GOP moved to recess the floor and cameras operated by the House majority were turned off, members used Periscope, Facebook and other social media platforms to broadcast their speeches. \u201dI am very worried about the trend and the precedent so we are looking at all options for consequences to make sure that we can get Congress working again,\u201d Ryan said, but wouldn\u2019t elaborate on what specific punishments could be handed down. Ryan lamented that that the House floor was the one place in Congress where members come together to work out differences and by ignoring the rules Democrats were denigrating the institution. He added that by tweeting and using Periscope to commandeer the floor \u201dwe have eviscerated any vestige of bipartisanship.\u201d Democrats end House   protest over gun control, But Democrats brushed aside threats of sanctions, and spent much of Thursday on the floor preventing GOP leaders from considering an annual spending bill for financial services. As the House opened up for the day, Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton went to the well for morning hour and began reading the names of gun violence victims on the floor. As he recited each name a series of House Democrats came up next to him in the well and held up pictures of victims. It is against the rules for more than one member to stand at the podium at a time. The presiding officer informed Moulton that his time expired, but he kept reading, so the Chair gaveled him down and recessed the House. When legislative business resumed, House Democrats lined up and asked one after another for \u201dunanimous consent\u201d for the House to take up gun legislation, holding pictures of victims of gun violence.
